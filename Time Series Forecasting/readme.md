# Capstone Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview

It has been a while since I completed a project. The last was my capstone project completed in October 2022. As of writing, 7 months have passed. I am modelling on time series data because it closely emulates what I do in my career.

### Problem Statement

The source of my data is from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview.
