Prothero,http religion b ogs cnn com my take a deadlv link between islamic and anti islam c extremists Editor s Note Stephen Prothero a Boston University religion scholar and author of The American Bible How Our Words Unite Divide and Define a Nation is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor By Stephen Prothero to CNN What should we make of the attacks on the U S consulates in Egypt Libya and Yemen and the deaths of four Americans including U S ambassador to Libya Chris It depends on who you mean by we From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies taking down the American flag in Egypt and replacing it with a black flag reading There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger theirs was an act of justice on of the One True Faith The Americans had it coming according to this view because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of civilizations between the Judeo Christian West and the Muslim world And the creation of an anti Islamic video ironically entitled Innocence of Muslims by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst or excuse for the protests Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed Most Americans operate by a different we From our perspective the assault was an unjust and cowardly attack on among other things the rule of law the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter I condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms This is an attack on America Libya and free people everywhere Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in later published as This Is Water novelist Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the natural basic self centeredness that puts me at the center of the world This unconscious default setting fosters the sort of blind certainty that manifests as arrogant atheism and fundamentalism alike Wallace said And the point of education is to shake us out of that default setting to begin to see things from the perspectives of others Follow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE

REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER Wallace focused in his speech on the individual I But his critique can be applied as well to another default setting this one more cultural than natural our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of Give According to those who stormed the embassies Innocence of Muslims was not made by an individual whoever the shadowy Sam Bacile may or may not be It was made by anAmerican Moreover according to this groupthink Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual Americans so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the protests turned deadly condemning the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions CNN s Belief Blog The faith angles behind the biggest stories Meanwhile the shadowy figures who produced and distributed Innocence of Muslims are imprisoned in some groupthink of their own which gathers all the world s Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire Their film doesn t just depict Mohammed as a con man philanderer and pedophile It portrays his followers as dupes Unfortunately the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks a man identifying himself as Sam Bacile reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that Islam is a cancer You don t need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled and you don t need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and religion And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than offending them with an ignorant movie Nonetheless the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as blind certainty Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines Muslims and Christians and Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians Neither is it divided secularists and people of faith the New Atheists and partisans of old time religion The real red line in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain And in the tragic events of recent days those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of innocents in Libya and Egypt Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of blind certainty unacquainted with both the complexity and contradictions of life on Earth and the cloud of unknowing that hovers over every major religion The great religious thinkers in Judaism Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not know everything They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all too flawed thoughts of ordinary people They knew in short that they are not God who alone is charged with creating and destroying the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory The killers in Libya have forgotten that So have the not so innocent producers and distributors of Innocence of Islam The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen

30,H: Romney's last gambit. Got done and published. Sid,http www salon comi o o or gops october surprisei Oct AM EDT GOP s surprise They re calling it the Jimmy Carter Strategy Exploit Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism By cY aia Credit AP AI Behrman Salort According to a highly reliable source as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the first presidential debate night top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new two pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security and will be based in part on inW ia en y iTeForrnation regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U S ambassador Chris on The source who has first hand knowledge of private high level conversations in the Romney tamp that took place in Washington DC last week said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the Surprise He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be a bombshell that would make Libya and Obama s foreign policy a major issue in the campaign My understanding is that they have come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration definitely had intel about the attack before it happened Intelligence can be graded in different ways he added and sometimes A and B don t get connected But the Romney campaign will try to paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a helpless Jimmy Carter like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter s failed attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t They are so excited about it he said Over and over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter s failed raid They feel it is going to give them a last minute landslide in the election The source however said lie was dubious about the tactic To me it is indicative that they have lost touch with a huge portion of the electorate he said The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present But he said These were the top guys in the party It was a private unguarded planning conversation He further U S Department of State Case No F

DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER described participants in the meeting as consisting of well known names tied to the big Republican super PACs and people who had access to high level national security intelligence As usual Karl Rove wasn t present he said but some were close to Rove The source said that there was quite a bit more to the operation than simply revealing the intelligence regarding Libya He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the operation However already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway On on Fox News Karl Rove called Obama s reaction to what happened in Libya inexplicable and added that Obama is more intent on campaigning than meeting his responsibilities as commander in chief He went on to warn that Obama s policies in Libya endangered the U S with regard to Iran I am astonished Rove said We are projecting weakness when we need to be projecting strength Similarly former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a one time GOP presidential hopeful who became known as the mayor of followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya This is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the most transparent in history he told Fox News And it s the worst kind of cover up the kind of cover up that involves our national security This is a cover up that involves the slaughter of four Americans Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al Qaeda because it seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden I think it s because they have this narrative that they defeated al Qaeda he said They never say the words Islamic fundamentalist terrorism They want to wish it away The president was moving on to Asia he was going to declare this a great victory for himself and unfortunately this terrible act of terror intervened in their very convenient narrative Likewise Bob Corker Republican senator from Tennessee described the administration s response to the terrorist attack in Libya as And on both Mitt Romney and vice presidential nominee Ryan joined in the attacks I think they want to do their very best to keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened We expect candor we expect transparency particularly as it relates to terrorism Romney said Added Ryan Why is he Obama not on the same page with his own administration officials who are saying that this is a terrorist attack We ll leave it up to you to decide whether it s a cover up or not In an apparently related development a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were divided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya One unnamed Romney adviser described them as a huge gift to the campaign Across the board domestic economic and foreign policy issues President Obama has been outmatched by events he said He s an observer of events not a shaper of events Everywhere you look he s been outmatched But other Romney advisers led by media strategist wanted to stick to the economy as the central issue They ll tell you that you ve got to focus people on the fact that their economic prospects are not very good and all that the aide told Politico Well Romney s been trying to do that now since he clinched the nomination at the end of and he s failed The president is better at deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on individual voters Craig Unger is the New York Times bestselling author of House of Bush House of Saud and a frequent analyst on CNN ABC Radio Air America The Charlie Rose Show NBC s Today Show

38,RE: H: Romney's last gambit. Got done and published. Sid,This is it Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me but of course I m biased Mitt Romney A New Course for the Middle East Restore the three sinews of American influence our economic strength our military strength and the strength of our values Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East In Syria tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered In Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood has come to power and the country s peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance In Libya our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack U S embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests And in Iran the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear weapons capability all the while promising to annihilate Israel These developments are not as President Obama says mere bumps in the road They are major issues that put our security at risk Yet amid this upheaval our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them We re not moving them in a direction that protects our people or our allies And that s dangerous If the Middle East descends chaos if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout or if Israel s security is compromised America could be pulled the maelstrom We still have time to address these threats but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East The first step is to understand how we got here Since World War II America has been the leader of the Free World We re unique in having earned that role not through conquest but through promoting human rights free markets and the rule of law We ally ourselves with like minded countries expand prosperity through trade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none But in recent years President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy Our economy is stuck in a recovery that barely deserves the name Our national debt has risen to record levels Our military tested by a decade of war is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House Finally our values have been misapplied and misunderstood by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder The Middle East is a case in point The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom But it also presented grave risks We needed a strategy for success but the president offered none And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few weeks The same incomprehension afflicts the president s policy toward Israel The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating daylight between our two countries He recently downgraded Israel from being our closest ally in the Middle East to being only one of our closest allies It s a diplomatic message that will be received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike He dismissed Israel s concerns about Iran as mere noise that he prefers to block out And at a time when Israel needs America to stand with it he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu In this period of uncertainty we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East that is both governments and individuals who share our values This means restoring our credibility with Iran When we say an Iranian nuclear weapons capability and the regional instability that comes with it is unacceptable the ayatollahs must be made to believe us It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to extremism But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence our economic strength our military strength and the strength Of our values That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date

91,"on ""This Week""",Here is on this week She wasn t asked about whether we had any intel But she did make clear our view that this started spontaneously and then evolved The only troubling sentence relates to the investigation specifically And we ll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances But she got pushed there Waiting on other transcripts For more on what happened and why let s bring in the U S ambassador to the United Nations Dr Dr thank you for joining us RICE Good to be with you TAPPER So first of all what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at the consulate in Benghazi We re hearing that the Libyans have arrested people They re saying that some people involved were from outside the country that there might have even been Al Qaida ties What s the latest information RICE Well first of all it s important to know that there s an FBI investigation that has begun and will take some time to be completed That will tell us with certainty what transpired But our current best assessment based on the information that we have at present is that in fact what this began as it was a spontaneous not a premeditated response to what had transpired in Cairo In Cairo as you know a few hours earlier there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated We believe that folks in Benghazi a small number of people came to the embassy to or to the consulate rather to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo And then as that unfolded it seems to have been hijacked let us say by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons weapons that as you know in in the wake of the revolution in Libya are are quite common and accessible And it then evolved from there U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER We ll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms but that s the best information we have at present TAPPER Why was there such a security breakdown Why was there not better security at the compound in Benghazi Why were there not U S Marines at the embassy in Tripoli RICE Well first of all we had a substantial security presence with our personnel TAPPER Not substantial enough though right RICE with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi Tragically two of the four Americans who were killed were there providing security That was their function And indeed there were many other colleagues who were doing the same with them It obviously didn t prove sufficient to the the nature of the attack and sufficient in that in that moment And that s why obviously we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the president has very been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the governments first of all to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel and we re reinforcing our facilities and our our embassies where possible TAPPER But why RICE and where needed TAPPER Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with It would seem like this this is obviously an unstable country This is a region where U S interests have been attacked in previous months Why were there not Marines there to begin with RICE First of all there are Marines in some places around the world There are not Marines in every facility That depends on the circumstances That depends on the requirements Our presence in Tripoli as in Benghazi is relatively new as you will recall We ve been back post revolution only for a matter of months But I ve visited there myself both to Tripoli and Benghazi I was very grateful to have a strong security presence with me as part of our our embassy detachment there So we certainly are aware that Libya is a place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents The security personnel that the State Department thought were required were in place And we ll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances But the president has been very clear The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will remain our top priority That s why we ve reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO

BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER TAPPER Look at this map if you would There have been protests around the world over the last several days And President Obama pledged to repair America s relationships with the Muslim world Why does the U S seem so impotent And why is the U S even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab countries than it was four years ago RICE we re not impotent We re not even less popular to challenge that assessment I don t know on what basis you make that judgment But let me let me point TAPPER It just seems that the U S government is powerless as this as this maelstrom erupts RICE It s actually the opposite First of all let s be clear about what transpired here What happened this week in Cairo in Benghazi in many other parts of the region TAPPER Tunisia Khartoum RICE was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated that the U S government had nothing to do with which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence there is that we have condemned it in the strongest possible terms But let s look at what s happened It s quite the opposite of being impotent We have worked with the governments in Egypt President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt And as soon as he did that the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased President Morsi TAPPER It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this RICE President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence He s called off and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop CROSSTALK RICE Now and and same frankly in Tunisia in Yemen and of course in Libya where the government has has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what has happened We are quite popular in Libya as you might expect having been a major partner in their revolution What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep seated anti Americanism on the part of the Libyan people Quite the contrary The counter demonstrations the outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador and for the United States the government of Libya and and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this is much more a reflection of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER STATE SCB U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER TAPPER That certainly according to polling is the case in Libya Not the case in Egypt And since you brought up President Morsi let me try to get some clarification on something President Obama was asked about the relationship with Egypt on and this is what he said BEGIN VIDEO CLIP OBAMA I don t think that we would consider them an ally but we don t consider them an enemy They are a new government that is trying to find its way END VIDEO CLIP TAPPER The United States has sent billions of dollars of U S taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few decades And by definition as you know according to the State Department Egypt is a major non NATO ally of the United States Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally RICE Well first of all the president has been very clear and and everybody understands that Egypt is a very critical partner of the United States has long been so That relationship remains the same and the president wasn t signaling any change in in the nature TAPPER Was he trying to nudge Morsi RICE The president wasn t signaling any change in the nature of our relationship Obviously the president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one in which he underscored that it s of course the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel and facilities including our own and we saw that President Morsi immediately after that took dramatic steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere and then went out and repeatedly made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the message that however hateful such a video may be there is absolutely no justification for violence against the United States or other Western partners So what we ve seen is that the president has been incredibly calm incredibly steady and incredibly measured in his approach to this set of developments And his interventions his leadership has ensured that in Egypt in Yemen in Tunisia in Libya and many other parts of the world that leaders have come out and made very plain that there s no excuse for this violence We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey say the same we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same that there s no excuse for violence that violence is to be condemned and that governments have a responsibility to protect United States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats TAPPER I know you have to go but very quickly was the president in that interview trying to nudge President Morsi Get your act together U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C

104,Meant to email earlier,
105,Jeff update,Contrast between Benghazi and reports from the West Here in Benghazi since I have joined our representative Chris in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC civil society UN organizations and NG s and the diplomatic corps While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed Operation Mermaid Dawn the timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped up activity in western Libya Clearly some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west Ali Tarhouni recently promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still to be completed cabinet reshufle previewed the Tripoli uprising with us down almost to the minute Yet one feels that to a large extent TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than the authors of the unfolding developments to the west In a telling anecdote just after confiding in us the plans for Tripoli about to unfold Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely manner What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content and the TNC just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human rights but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward thinking Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli Benghazi does not While there s a sense in the air that the final battles have begun that palpable anticipation does not seem to have translated the type of stepped up bureaucratic activity that one would expect After meeting with us for nearly two hours on TNC Executive Committee chair and PM equivalent Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than head any kind of war room here I was on the ground far longer than Jibril giving another cameo appearance here Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli should Tripoli fall TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here is a humble retiring leader which after Qadhafi s flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas The question is when Tripoli falls do the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for Tripoli I do not want to overplay this the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here Our visit to the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow if not exactly command and control passing between east and west Tarhouni and others who visit western towns usually from Tunis describe support there and from tribal leaders across Libya No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC Still in our engagement with TNC officials we will need to remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum that others could fill especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here not there We ve talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided which we argued would be the best solution One of the TNC s assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote and how Qadhafi has treated Libya s citizens The world s attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli we cautioned and acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did The damage to the TNC s credibility could be irreparable We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the Benghazi leadership The TNC officials heard us out patiently but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate They feel confident about the current military situation and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no matter how high the pressure If anything their positions have hardened in recent weeks with Abduljalil telling us that the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same category as his father I do not believe that anything short of a significant change Qadhafi s departure a military U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER STATE SCB U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER setback that punctures the TNC s current confidence NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out Tarhouni also acknowledged with his trademark candor that to the Libyan people right now negotiations would appear weak and not a satisfactory climax to the revolution They do have a point that despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi e g Mohammed Ismail s multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is prepared to throw in the towel There is real fear that should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha a guerilla war could persist for years with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border Among other topics we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high profile discussion immediately on the reconciliation which is part of the TNC s platform We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi s year rule will be less likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through rule of law accountability The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained as part of Qadhafi s regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution INC officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models and they reiterated their commitment for an inclusive process for Libya s future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi Yet they still seem to rely largely on variously described luck tribal discipline and the gentle character of the Libyan people as the best assurances against abuse and revenge killings We will continue to push on this Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination With tribal visits and investigation committees and cabinet changes the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension and gunfire quickly dissipated But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had previously tried to downplay tribes and militias Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans TNC officials are now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and pillaging that destroyed Benghazi s security infrastructure in Tribes we heard can also be a corrective balance to Islamist leanings On reining in the militias we heard no good answers Some people Tarhouni INC National Security Advisor Bazama some civil society representatives spoke frankly about the problem including the Islamist leanings of the most powerful The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels but a couple of people noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative Others seemed to rely again on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After There was widespread disdain for Qatar s role in encouraging certain militia elements and I will be able to cite lots of concern here when I go to Doha later Qatar s role too is a subject better discussed elsewhere We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC s financial needs increase as more territory falls under rebel control they are worried that if they can t provide electricity to newly liberated towns or fund other services there disenchantment with the TNC will grow Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to discuss Libya s outstanding debts to see if he can help us get India s hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted Briefed on South Africa s objections fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa although part of our South Africa problem may derive from Jibril s poor relations with Zuma with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making Nelson Mandela feel ashamed Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out attending himself I ve spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here and the UAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC which may be our fastest way of getting funds here assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE s needs and passes the scrutiny of the U S interagency process My traveling companions Bill Roebuck NEA MAG director and Ben Fishman from the NSS start their return trip

118,Libya,Associated Press Published BENGHAZI lli YA Hundreds of protesters angry over last week s killing of the U S ambassador to Libya stormed the compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya s rampant militias the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the Ansar Al Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi Ansar Al Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd but eventually abandoned the site with their weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting No to militias I don t want to see armed men wearing Afghani style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders I only want to see people in uniform said Omar Mohammed a university student who took part in the takeover of the site which protesters said was done in support of the army and police No deaths were reported in the incident which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed militias One vehicle was also burned at the compound For many Libyans the Sept attack on the U S Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago the multiple mini armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police The militias a legacy of the rag tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi s regime tout themselves as protectors of Libya s revolution providing security where police cannot But many say they act like gangs detaining and intimidating rivals and carrying out killings Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don t abide by their hardline ideology Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al Shariati led the attack on the U S consulate which killed Amb Chris and three other Americans After taking over the Ansar compound protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist militia Rafallah Sahati The militiamen opened fire on the protesters who were largely unarmed At least were wounded and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed Earlier in the day some people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al Shariah No no to militias the crowd chanted filling a broad boulevard They carried banners and signs demanding that militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security Benghazi is in a trap signs read Where is the army where is the police

ambassador was Libya s friend and Libya lost a friend Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead and police mingled in the crowd buoyed by the support of the protesters The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi Libya s second largest city and home to million people since the fall of Qaddafi in The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government which has been unable to rein in the armed factions Many say that officials attempts to co opt fighters by paying them have only fueled the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them the regular forces Residents of another main eastern city Darna have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al Shariah and other militias The anti militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of Benghazi has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists During the Qaddafi era it was the hotbed of a deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna During the revolt against him last year Qaddafi s regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and ally itself with Al Qaeda But now the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al Shariah the main Islamic extremist group in the city The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation It was disastrous said Ayoub al Shedwi a young bearded Muslim preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio show he hosts We felt that the revolution is going in vain Leaders of tribes which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya have come forward to demand that the militias disband Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no longer have their protection in the face of anti militia protests That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are killed Activists and residents have held a sit in for the past eight days outside Darna s Sahaba Mosque calling on tribes to put an end to the state of terrorism created by the militias Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna On the same day killed in Benghazi a number of elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services were attacked reportedly beaten or stabbed There have been killings over the past few months including the city security chief and assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi s military Darna s residents are conservative but they largely don t fit the city s reputation as extremists Women wear headscarves but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face In the ancient city s narrow alleys shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare Western songs And many are impatient with Ansar Al Sharjah s talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law The group s name means Supporters of Shariah Law We are not infidels for God sake We have no bars no discos we are not practicing vice in the street said Wassam ben Madin a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising against

against Qaddafi But if you say no to integrating the police and army we will storm your place It s over Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias The armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police So the government has created a High Security Committee aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to integration Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as dinars around to join compared to the average police monthly salary of around However the militias that join still do not abide by government authority and critics say the lure of salaries has only prompted more militias to form Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the month civil war against Gadhafi at around But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several hundred thousand All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming said Khaled Hadar a Benghazi based lawyer The government is only making temporarily solutions but you are creating a disaster U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C

144,AP - defends Benghazi remarks,AP defends Benghazi remarks By Associated Press PM EST U S Ambassador said her early account of the attack that killed the U S ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subject to review and updates She said she respected Sen McCain R Ariz who has been critical of her but said some of the statements he s made about me have been unfounded but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss all of this with him Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely denounced by Republicans during the U S presidential campaign The attack came an the th anniversary of the Sept terror attacks on the United States and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on the anniversary The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack Obama s first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton who is not expected to stay on during his second term told reporters outside the U N Security Council As a senior U S diplomat I agreed to a White House request to appear on the shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day which at that time were primarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities American diplomatic facilities around the world and Iran s nuclear program Hours before the Benghazi violence a mob in Cairo attacked the U S Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti Islamic blasphemy Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris foreign service officer Sean and two former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods said The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this pattern When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to me by the intelligence community she said I made clear that the information was preliminary and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers she added U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER STATE SCB

Ambassador died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago He spoke eloquently about his passion for service for diplomacy and for the Libyan people This assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco As the conflict in Libya unfolded Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new free nation He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started Chris was committed to advancing America s

experts risk their lives in the service of our country and our values because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world that these aspirations are worth

those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed in marble Our hearts break over each one And now because of this tragedy we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn Chris fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco He joined the Foreign Service learned languages won friends for America in distant places and made other people s hopes his own In the early days of the Libyan revolution I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships

to our country service that took him from Pretoria to and finally to Benghazi The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward This is not easy Today many Americans are asking indeed I asked myself how could this happen How could this happen in a country we helped liberate in a city we helped save from destruction This question reflects just how complicated and at times how confounding the world can be But we must be clear eyed even in our grief This was an attack by a small and savage group not the people or Government of Libya Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya in a country scarred by war and tyranny they were hailed as friends and partners And when the attack came yesterday Libyans stood and fought to defend our post Some were wounded Libyans carried Chris body to the hospital and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety And last night when I spoke with the President of Libya he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible The friendship between our countries borne out of shared struggle will not be another casualty of this attack A free and stable Libya is still in America s interest and security and we will not turn our back on that nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and surely We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies consulates and citizens There will be more time later to reflect but today we have work to do There is no higher priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo yesterday as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet America s commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation But let me be clear there is no justification for this none Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God the world will never know a true and lasting peace It is especially difficult that this happened on I I th It s an anniversary that means a great deal to all Americans Every year on that day we are reminded

proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of our country and our values They help make the United States the greatest force for peace progress and human dignity that the world has ever known We honor the memory of our fallen colleagues by continuing their work and carrying on the best traditions of a bold and generous nation Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U S Morocco Strategic Dialogue SECRETARY CLINTON Good morning Well let me welcome our friends and colleagues from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department for this very important first session of the U S Morocco Strategic Dialogue Before I begin to address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with Morocco I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere and we certainly hope and expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests violence I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these protests in a number of countries Let me state very clearly and I hope it is obvious that the United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video We absolutely reject its content and message America s commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation And as you know we are home to people of all religions many of whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion including of course millions of Muslims And we have the greatest respect for people of faith To us to me personally this video is disgusting and reprehensible It appears to have a deeply cynical purpose to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage But as I said yesterday there is no justification none at all for responding to this video with violence We condemn the violence that has resulted in the strongest terms and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue Violence we believe has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion Islam like other religions respects the fundamental dignity of human beings and it is a violation of that fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents As long as there are those who are willing to shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion the name of God the world will never know a true and lasting peace It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against diplomatic missions These are places whose very purpose is peaceful to promote better understuiding across countries and cultures All governments have a responsibility to protect U S

is to attack the idea that we can work together to build understanding and a better future Now I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day Now I would note that in today s world with today s technologies that is impossible But even if it were possible our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our Constitution and our law and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no matter how distasteful they may be There are of course different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and free expression but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in response to speech is not acceptable We all whether we are leaders in government leaders in civil society or religious leaders must draw the line at violence And any responsible leader should be standing up now and drawing that line I wanted to begin with this statement because as our Moroccan friends and all of you know this has been a difficult week at the State Department I very much appreciate Minister the condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy happened far away in Benghazi we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco to the United States It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans we lost this week Ambassador Chris fell in love with the region when he served as a Peace Corps volunteer there That experience set him on a decades long career of service So in the memory of fallen friends and colleagues let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better future In many ways the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model His Majesty King Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you ve undertaken In fact after my visit to Rabat earlier this year I told my team We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco No country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco You were the first nation to recognize us back in But we re not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is longstanding We want one that is dynamic growing looking toward the future So let me highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today On political reform we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and the Middle East I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of these changes by holding free and fair elections empowering the elected parliament taking other steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people Today our political working group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate commitments actions Because as we all know democracy real reform require that people themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives the courts reformed the government more U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER STATE SCB U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER open and transparent universal human rights of all Moroccans men and women alike respected I m especially pleased by Morocco s commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of child marriage We know that child brides are less likely to get an education more likely to face life threatening problems particularly around child birth and delivery which not only shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents So we want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on this issue With regard to the Western Sahara the United States continues to support efforts to find a peaceful sustainable mutually agreed upon solution U S policy toward the Western Sahara has remained consistent for many years We have made clear that Morocco s autonomy plan is serious realistic and credible and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity We continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work toward resolution With respect to the economy our second working group will focus on what more can be done to deliver tangible economic benefits Morocco s economy is relatively healthy but you face the same problem that is now endemic across the world unemployment is still too high especially among young people That s why the United States is providing million to support an effort to attract foreign investors foster local economic development and combat corruption across the region And I m pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries Today we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade a particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe I d like to increase the amount of trade coming to the United States and also to improve economic integration across North Africa which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco s stability and Morocco s very strong economic foundation The greater integration there is the greater the benefits for Moroccans Third the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue Through our work together on the Counterterrorism Task Force the United States and Morocco already share crucial information and best practices and I thank Morocco for hosting a Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO

BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER We are also collaborating through USAID the Peace Corps and other agencies to help provide Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations And so we are partnering to help strengthen Morocco s criminal justice system and law enforcement There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today And let me add the United States greatly appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council especially your support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new democratic future for that country I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People and we look forward to continuing to work closely together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended Finally our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration This year marks the th anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us There are more than Moroccan alumni of these programs Two are with us today Dr Benjelloun and Dr Ouaouicha and we thank them But among all our work on this front from preserving Morocco s historic sites to empowering youth there s one area I particularly hope we can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel namely interfaith dialogue In these tense and turbulent times it s more important than ever for people of different faiths to exchange ideas to build understanding to promote religious tolerance It s one of the great challenges of the st century and it s one that we must address together So we have a lot of work to do Minister but our friendship runs long and deep and as the treaty our nations signed in says and I quote Trusting in God it will remain permanent I m confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations stronger more peaceful more secure more prosperous and also contribute to doing the same for the world So again let me welcome you Minister It s been a great pleasure for me to get to know you to work with you to be your colleague bilaterally regionally and globally and also welcome your distinguished delegation Thank you Applause Remarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul Fitr SECRETARY CLINTON Good evening and

SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER Tonight our gathering is more somber than any of us would like This comes during sad and difficult days for the State Department family We lost four Americans They were good and brave men They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of Libya And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms the violence against our posts in Benghazi in Egypt and now in Yemen The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight and I want to take a moment to thank him for the support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this tragedy particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our ambassador Ambassador Aujali would you mind saying a few words AMBASSADOR AMU redacted SECRETARY CLINTON Thank you very much Ambassador I know that that was a very personal loss for you as it was for me I m the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation any people Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well All people of faith and good will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God in any way Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world many of whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time Unfortunately however over the last hours we have also seen violence spread elsewhere Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory despicable material posted on the intemet As I said earlier today the United States rejects both the content and the message of that video The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others At our meeting earlier today my colleague the foreign minister of Morocco said that all prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity for all humanity But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out against violence and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack Think about it When Christians are subject to insults to their faith and that certainly happens we expect them not to resort to violence When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to their faiths and that also certainly happens we expect them not to resort to violence The same goes for all faiths including Islam U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT

SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER When all of us who are people of faith and I am one feel the pain of insults of misunderstanding of denigration to what we cherish we must expect ourselves and others not to resort to violence That is a universal standard and expectation and it is everyone s obligation to meet that so that we make no differences we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of others You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults They have withstood offense for centuries Refraining from violence then is not a sign of weakness in one s faith it is absolutely the opposite a sign that one s faith is unshakable So tonight we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust hatred and fear We can pledge that whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry ten voices will answer They will answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult answering ignorance with enlightenment answering hatred with understanding answering darkness with light that if one person commits a violent act in the name of religion millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength In times like these it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable some mountains too steep to climb we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and peacefulness that we seek and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue But that s not what I believe and I don t think it s what you believe either here tonight Part of what makes our country so special is we keep trying We keep working We keep investing in our future We keep supporting the next generation believing that young people can keep us moving forward in a positive direction So tonight I think it s important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek but also about some of the things the real practical tangible things that young people are doing to help shape that better future Two years ago in this room at our Eid reception we launched a program called Generation Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities And I asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors to help build personal connections seek out partners in other countries And I can report to you tonight they did not disappoint In a few minutes you re going to meet some of these young leaders each with a powerful story to tell The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe We are building an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities They act as mentors spark respectful debates simply offer words of encouragement when needed But most importantly they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual understanding and respect one person at a time U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE

Our Hours Against Hate initiative encourages young people to put themselves in another person s shoes through service projects So far young people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a different background to see them as a fellow human being not a stereotype not a caricature but another real live person people who don t look like you live like you pray like you but with whom we will share this planet And therefore we have work to do People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance In my tradition like all traditions we are expected to love one another And together we have to translate that better understanding and cooperation I m particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from tonight are really setting an example not only for young people elsewhere in the world but frankly for us who are older as well Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these efforts Farah Pandith is the Department s first to Muslim Communities And from the beginning she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top priority Farah will introduce you to

high hopes for the future Sean leaves behind a loving wife Heather two young children Samantha and Nathan and scores of grieving family friends and colleagues And that s just in this world Because online in the virtual worlds that Sean helped create he is also being mourned by countless competitors collaborators and garners who shared his passion Tyrone Woods known to most as Rone spent two decades as a Navy SEAL serving multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan Since he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East He had the hands of a healer as well as the arms of a warrior earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic Our hearts go out to Tyrone s wife Dorothy and his three sons Tyrone Jr Hunter and Kai born

deployed to some of the most dangerous places on Earth including Iraq and Afghanistan always putting his life on the line to safeguard other Americans Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen s father Bernard his mother Barbara his brother Gregory his sister Kathleen and their grieving families friends and colleagues I was honored to know Ambassador Chris I want to thank his parents and siblings who are here today for sharing Chris with us and with our country What a wonderful gift you gave us Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service Chris won friends for the United States in far flung places He made those people s hopes his own During the revolution in Libya he risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant and he gave his life helping them build a better country People loved to work with Chris And as he rose through the ranks they loved to work for Chris He was known not only for his courage but for his smile goofy but contagious for his sense of fun and that California cool In the days since the attack so many Libyans including the Ambassador from Libya to the United States who is with us today have expressed their sorrow and solidarity One young woman her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness held up a handwritten sign that said Thugs and killers don t represent Benghazi nor Islam The President of the Palestinian Authority who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem sent me a letter remembering his energy and integrity and deploring and I quote an act of ugly terror Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country We ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men We ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to do with It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless and it is totally unacceptable The people of Egypt Libya Yemen and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts And we will under the President s leadership keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world There will be more difficult days ahead but it is important that we don t lose sight of the fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world We owe it to those four men to continue the long hard work of diplomacy I am enormously proud of the men and women of the State Department I m proud of all those across our government civilian and military alike who U S

great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department earlier this week to grieve with us He well understands and values the work that these men were doing for our country The President of the United States Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their Meeting SECRETARY CLINTON Good afternoon everyone And it is such a pleasure for me to welcome my friend and colleague Secretary Espinosa along with a very distinguished delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the highest levels of each of our governments Before I turn to the matters discussed today let me give a brief update on the ongoing U S response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere I m sure as you know already we are taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide That includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary And we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials and there is nothing more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide At the same time as I have said to State Department employees the incidents of the past week highlight how important our work is The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the world Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values because they know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress That is worth striving and sacrificing for and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact Now turning to our friends and partners in Mexico we are always pleased to have a chance to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us Mexico is one of our closest friends as well as partner on dozens of critical issues So we talk about every kind of issue you can imagine from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment But today we focused on a top priority for us both a security U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER STATE SCB U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER We just co chaired the fourth meeting of the U S Mexico Merida High Level Consultative Group This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration And I want to offer my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it The Merida Initiative represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal organizations including drug traffickers illegal arms traffickers money launderers and violent gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border we well know there is no quick and easy way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice But nevertheless during the past now nearly four years our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe And I think the habits of cooperation we have built are among our most important achievements and we will rely on them for a long time to come Today our delegations reviewed the gains we ve made on key priorities including improving law enforcement coordination reducing the demand for drugs modernizing our border infrastructure strengthening the rule of law and building more resilient and empowered communities We also discussed the lessons we ve learned and the work that lies ahead in these and other areas which our joint statement will reflect I want to underscore how important our security relationship with Mexico is to the United States The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these criminals with courage and resolve and we remain committed to doing everything we can to support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice This is a transnational problem and it calls for a transnational solution and the United States believes this is a matter of shared responsibility That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to Mexico and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together Making sure our people are safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us Now our two countries share many other priorities and one of them empowering women and girls was also addressed today We took the opportunity the Foreign Secretary and I to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender equality empower girls and women promote their human rights and enhance their security So again Secretary Espinosa let me thank you for years of work and effort for our productive conversations in many places around the world and again today and for being such a valuable colleague and partner The United States deeply deeply values our relationship with Mexico and the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED

come and go but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our countries for many years ahead So thank you very much MS NULAND We ll take inaudible Margaret Brennan CBS News QUESTION Madam Secretary thanks for your time Are you any closer to finding who killed Ambassador Chris Libya s President says this attack was planned for months Are you confident he s wrong and that security measures were appropriate And will you leave justice to the Libyans SECRETARY CLINTON As I said at the outset we are taking aggressive steps to protect our people and our consulates and embassies around the world We are reviewing our security posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security needs are wherever necessary We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four colleagues and under what circumstances As I said the FBI has joined the investigation inside Libya and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region In a number of places where protests have tuned violent we are seeing the hand of extremists who are trying to exploit people s inflamed passions for their own agendas But overwhelmingly we have found that the people of Egypt of Libya of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob They want to turn their attention to the future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children and they want a strong partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual respect This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies In Libya for example in their first free elections moderates were successful at the polls But look there are extremists in all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American facilities And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week these extremist efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as to the region and the United States And I think it s important at this moment for leaders to put themselves on the right side of this debate to speak out clearly and unequivocally against violence whoever incites it or conducts it And in a struggle like this there can be no doubt where the United States must stand We support those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in in democracy in U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM

with partners and allies in the region and around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that they experienced can be realized And finally on your specific point about Benghazi we obviously never talk publicly about security at any of our missions for obvious reasons But that said let me assure you that our security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces as well as a local guard force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world In addition to the security outside the compound we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound And with all of our missions overseas in advance of lid as is done every year we did an evaluation on threat streams And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or imminent But let me state the obvious again Our diplomats engage in dangerous work and it s the nature of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on There is risk inherent in what we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every single day and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with Thank you Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana Natalegawa After Their Meeting SECRETARY CLINTON Good afternoon everyone And it s such a pleasure as always to welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come from Indonesia for the purpose of our third meeting of the U S Indonesia Joint Commission This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership and the agreement to that effect was signed in Thanks to this partnership the United States and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce And today Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time of the last year because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago And I must say I

WAIVER But before I start I d like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the world We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from these protests And as I have said the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible and the United States Government of course had absolutely nothing to do with it But there is no justification for violence and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his government for speaking out against violence We have to look to reasonable people and responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen Today s meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together And one of our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific Today I m announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight AH D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government This agreement will strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region On growth and prosperity we are increasing our trade relationship that topped billion last year Investments in transportation energy and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting economic growth in both countries For example the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone represents billion in trade over the next decade Indonesia s Government has announced half a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements and we recently signed a memorandum of understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects And yesterday we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact with Indonesia Over the next five years the United States will invest million in clean energy development child health and nutrition programs and efforts to help make Indonesia s Government more transparent and open The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in and we are confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic integration across the Asia Pacific Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem global economy That s why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities Academic exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the United States have increased by one third USAID has recently expanded its basic education program to provide million for teacher training and literacy programs for

Burma to combating climate change to working to end the violence in Syria We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south south and triangular cooperation such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on women s empowerment We believe that as the second and third largest democracies in the world the United States and Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights And for the last four years Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful democratic transitions through example and open dialogue Last year more than countries attended And once again the United States will be sending a high level delegation So Minister thank you for everything Thank you for the great partnership we ve had between us and between our countries MS NULAND We ll take two questions today we ll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera English QUESTION Thank you Madam Secretary Mr Foreign Minister Madam Secretary my question is about the ongoing investigation last week s attack at the consulate in Benghazi You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the concerns that they understandably have First there is the federal mandate to establish an accountability review board Have you done so Who would you like to see chair it Are there certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of Foreign Service Officers around the world And related to this given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half are you satisfied that in light of those political changes enough was done to protect those working in the Middle East and North Africa And then finally and this is perhaps going the area of rumor and speculation but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador felt that he was on a quote al Qaida hit list Is this a scurrilous rumor Is this gallows humor when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge or is there something more to what he allegedly and I stress that word said U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO

BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER SECRETARY CLINTON Well first let me say I m looking forward to the opportunity to go up to the Congress today I will be briefing in two separate sessions the House and the Senate in a classified setting along with my interagency colleagues as we continue to work together and with governments around the world to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe I will be joined today by the Director of National Intelligence General Clapper by the Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Winnefeld along with experts from the FBI the State Department and elsewhere in the government Now I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our people and our embassies and consulates The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the superb support we have had from the U S military in the wake of these events and we are at the very early stages of an FBI investigation The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be chaired by Ambassador Pickering I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of the events of the past days There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies these fragile societies but as I said last week the vast majority of the people in these countries did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob And we are concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities but we are concerned about the internal security in these countries because ultimately that puts at risk the men women and children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore security and civil order And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values values that we see at work in Indonesia the third largest democracy in the world We believe that these values of universal rights of justice and accountability of democracy are there for every person regardless of where that person might live So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of Congress As to your final question I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there s any basis for that QUESTION Thank you MS NULAND Last question Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine please QUESTION Yes Madam thank you My question is Starting today U S Embassy and Consulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball which could be U S Department of State Case No F

which has Muslim majority population like Indonesia Madam Clinton how do you see this threat as on the long run If it s continuing happen it s obviously could give impact to the implementation of inaudible program in Indonesia What is the reason U S Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia What is your expectation from Indonesia Government for my Minister Marty Natalegawa How Indonesia Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate it s starting today Is U S Indonesia Government has capability to protect U S Embassy and Consulate So the inaudible program implemented could be implemented successfully in Indonesia Thank you SECRETARY CLINTON Well let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia and in particular from the law enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia We are very grateful for not only the cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities but also to the strong statements condemning violence from the President the Foreign Mihister and others In consultation with the Government of Indonesia we have temporarily for tomorrow closed our facilities We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security So we are cooperating completely and we re very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA Hello inaudible if I may just also respond Precisely as the Secretary had said the decision by the United States Government to close temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that s been made based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United States as well So in other words it is an informed decision a decision that is not intended to show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone but it is what it is and it s quite some it s the kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it even in our case Some of our embassies abroad when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the embassy we do that as well So it is something that is quite regular and something that is actually coordinated as well But if I may just broaden the subject matter I think as our President had said in the past Indonesian Government the Indonesian people even obviously cannot and would not condone the any acts of violence against diplomatic premises against diplomatic personnel because that is truly would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among states So that s our point of departure At the same time of course beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies we have still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date

much FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA Thank you Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting Good afternoon and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to Washington as foreign minister We ve had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other settings but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral relationship as well as regional and global issues I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week Today we ve once again seen protests in several cities in Pakistan Unfortunately some of those protests have turned violent and sadly resulted in loss of life I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore Peshawar and Karachi And I want to be clear as I have said on numerous occasions the violence we have seen cannot be tolerated There is no justification for violence Of course there is provocation and we have certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation We found the video that s at the core of this series of events offensive disgusting reprehensible But that does not provide justification for violence and therefore it is important for responsible leaders indeed responsible people everywhere to stand up and speak out against violence and particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own extremist ideologies Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress I made it clear that keeping our people everywhere in the world safe is our top priority What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important contributions to the work of our missions The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today and it is no secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States And we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda So U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER STATE SCB U S

high level meetings Ambassador Marc Grossman has just returned from consultations in Islamabad I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week at the UN General Assembly At each meeting we are working to identify the strategic goals we share and there are many and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike We face a common threat from a common enemy and we must confront terrorism and extremism together Earlier this month I designated the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every available legal authority to end their deadly attacks Pakistan s parliament has called for expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan s territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations And the follow through on this is challenging but necessary and we look forward to working with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems We have both pledged to support a secure stable and prosperous Afghanistan which is vital for the security of the region And I want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan s reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow the movement of goods to Afghanistan We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad which brought together Afghan Pakistani and U S representatives to advance the peace process in Afghanistan The Pakistani Government s public call for insurgents to come forward and talk with the Afghan Government was particularly important We are ready to work together to build on these steps and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U S Afghanistan Pakistan Core Group Now of course our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns and today we will discuss the many other ways in which we work together particularly to create economic opportunity for Pakistanis Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic relationship from aid to trade and investment We are working to help Pakistan attract more private sector investment We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon And we ve created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan s small and medium sized companies get access to capital Over the past few years we have seen Pakistan s civilian government begin to put down stronger roots And if elections proceed as planned next year it will mark the first time in Pakistan s history that a civilian led government has served its full term The United States supports Pakistan s economic development and we have said many times that we want to see democracy succeed in Pakistan U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM

the United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives Thank you very much Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting SECRETARY CLINTON Good morning I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from Tunisia I m looking forward to our meeting We obviously have a great deal to discuss and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the violent assaults of last We are monitoring events closely today There is no higher priority for President Obama and myself than the safety of our people We ve taken a number of steps around the world to augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts And we are working closely with host governments in this effort As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international agreements all governments have the duty the solemn duty to defend diplomatic missions They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on many important issues and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting violence and holding violent actors accountable We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the security of our facilities We ve also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice those responsible for these violent attacks And we have offered and will continue to look for ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout their country first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves We look forward to continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people Our relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies a commitment to nonviolence to tolerance and inclusivity for all people and to upholding the rule of law The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy They were the first of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see

cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans if they aren t already doing so about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya The Libyans held similarly heated debates on this very topic in the early s as they held their first parliamentary elections and drafted their constitution there were actually violent skirmishes in connection with those elections and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things had calmed down Hopefully the current leadership can negotiate these issues peaceably in the corning months

Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA WAIVER Let me know your thoughts SOURCE Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council as well as the highest levels of European Governments and Western Intelligence and security services On Libyan National Transitional Council NTC President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a close advisor that he is considering when or even if to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for the government of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al Keib According to a source with access to the NTC leadership Jalil realizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technical experts Jaili continues to believe that for the moment the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalist movement toward a semi autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica Barge in Arabic This situation continues to complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country With this in mind Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of no confidence for el Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association Instead according to this source Jalil is considering delaying a CiOCISI possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of Source Comment In the opinion of this individual the NTC has been able to reach a temporary understanding with the eastern federalists allowing the separatists to administer their local regions while deferring to the NTC for national and international issues The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regarding who has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms As of the week of no decision has been reached on this point The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge and Jalil now believes they can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government In particular Jalil according to a sensitive source is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalist movement against the need for a sense of national unity In the opinion of this source el Keib s future depends on Jalil s opinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el Keib s cabinet and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused security situation in Tripoli However while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regarding possible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia s loyal to the eastern federalists Unfortunately from Jalil s point of view this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightened tension between the eastern and western portions of the country According to this source after reviewing the federalist problem Dr Abd al Nasser Shamata the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC believes that el Keib al Juwali Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC individuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups In the opinion of this source Jalil is factoring this position his decision on el Keib Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms Shamata told Jalil that for the most part the existing fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political and tribal leaders However since el Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration it is difficult for firms to initiate new projects since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign such agreements Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister whoever he is must establish an orderly administration before full advantage can be gained from the oil fields In the meantime Shamata warns that his office has found evidence of corruption between local officials and international firms In this regard he stated that local representatives of the Italian national oil firm ENI have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of the country where their oil fields are located He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans but he believes ENI management in Italy is aware of this situation Shamata pointed out without additional comment that Ben Yezza is a long time senior official of ENI In the opinion this source Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI at least until they decide how best to move forward on el Keib whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address his problems proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own Source Comment According to this source el Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bring order to the National Army disarm independent militias and establish security throughout the country The leading opposition to el Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC and as many as of the active NTC members will vote against el Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote The source warns that these numbers are provided by members of this Political committee who may have their own agenda A two thirds majority is required for the no confidence vote however several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituent assembly has been elected They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people U S Department of State Case No F Doc No C Date STATE DEPT PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION REDACTIONS NO FOIA

812,What can we do?,Pis read the following I ve followed this case Torture on homefront cries out for justice Comments http www suntimes com news marin CST EDT caro article BY CAROL MARIN cmarin suntimes com Sun Times Columnist The feds can t just yet deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey But they are frighteningly closer And the irony screams out Carol Mann On the same day Holder President Obama s attorney general announced he would appoint a special counsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects a U S appeals court at the behest of the U S government ruled that it didn t have a problem sending Parlak back to the country where he was tortured imprisoned for months shocked with electrodes hung by his arms and sexually violated A Turkish Kurd Parlak was granted political asylum in It was before our government got cozier with Turkey before it re classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as terrorist and before the attacks of Sept With Ibrahim Parlak s horror began anew Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department s Immigration courts Instead of seeing a hard working tax paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan a small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert Mich tlie feds now saw an international menace In the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up If it hadn t been for a volunteer team of lawyers including a Reagan appointed former U S attorney a former FBI anti terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan s Sen Carl Levin a liberal Democrat and Rep Fred Upton a conservative Republican Parlak would still be in jail Thanks to them this year old father of a year old girl is temporarily free But just barely The newest outrage is the decision issued by Cincinnati s th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holder launched his torture inquiry B The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after Judge Julia Gibbons and Judge Sutton upheld the Justice Department s Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose his relationship to the now labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member Let s remember something about our immigration courts They are not independent They work for whoever is the attorney general And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now controversial Bush appointees Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Posner of the th Circuit Court of Appeals one of the nation s most brilliant judges By of Posner noted a staggering percent of the petitions had been reversed due to according to one ruling a willingness to ignore the most basic of facts Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal Judge Boyce F Martin a Carter appointee writes with both clarity and conviction arguing the government s awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of our country Like a surgeon Martin dissects the Justice Department s immigration courts and the majority opinion of his own colleagues and ends by saying I remain hopeful nevertheless that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid overzealous error riddled and misguided anti terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by the wayside It is just a shame that even if my hope proves true it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak Parlak s legal team will appeal Meanwhile Holder like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him is the new boss of the immigration courts As he investigates questions of U S torture abroad here s hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture of Ibrahim Parlak

815,Another perspective,The following is from an observer who I think is right about the need for more strategy time which means we have to have a better balance about travel time I d like your reactions Thx When it comes to foreign policy all see you doing a great job You must be literally killing yourself I can see your schedule is bruising But you probably need more strategy time less events as the ultimate judgment will be on whether iran nk get the bomb progress in Mideast success in Afghanistan Iraq Obama s pause on Afghanistan goes well with elite media and left that is against all wars but not with swing male voters who are defecting And I think it is making the rest of your job much tougher because the delay in the decision is looking Carterlike to US adversaries any decision is better than no decision But all roads likely lead to Iran and perhaps Pakistan rest is secondary at this point That s my view for what it s worth Take care

968,Speech,sullivanij state gov B Thanks for all your hard work on this difficult speech to get it as right as possible Here are a few comments and questions We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top I haven t read it yet so not sure what s most appriopriate Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground should we be explicit in asserting that this speech further clarifies expands explains what this Admin means by human rights The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here too For example in discussion on p about Japanese internment etc In the section about supporting individual defenders should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony honoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same Tell story about how I was asked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might literally save her life Look forward to further discussion later today

Those guys are doing all the real work And anecdotally they re seeing great success already with a lot more to come E diplomacy Hillary Clinton Embraces New Media By MATTHEW LEE AP Sat Mar WASHINGTON AP Her videos aren t quite viral yet and she s not tweeting but Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is embracing new media using the Web to promote the agency and her role as the nation s top envoy In less than three months Clinton s State Department has embarked on a digital diplomacy drive aimed at spreading the word about American foreign policy and restoring Washington s image Part of a broader Internet outreach by President Barack Obama s administration Clinton s Web efforts already have outpaced those of her predecessors Since taking over at Foggy Bottom Clinton s team has built on e diplomacy innovations developed during W Bush s presidency They have revamped the department s Web site http www state gov and the Dipnote blog http blogs state gov and http twitter com dipnote with a fresh array of features graphics and colorful posts Users can track her foreign travel on an interactive map http www state gov secretary trvI map trip id They can keep up virtually with her every move through Facebook Twitter Flickr and YouTube http www youtube com user statevideo They can pose questions through an ask the secretary column http www state gov r pa ei ask secretary htm that recently was revised to text the secretary http www state gov r pa ei ask secretary htm New media is critical in this new era of diplomacy where smart power and expanded dialogues are essential to achieving our foreign policy goals said Clinton s longtime confidante and chief of staff Even for a government Web site early indications show a surge in interest according to internal State Department statistics provided to The Associated Press Daily views of the Dipnote have doubled from a year ago to today with subscribers to its RSS feed twice as many as in The number of followers of the department on Twitter has tripled since Jan when Obama took office while the department s Facebook friends have increased by times in the same period What they are bringing in is more willingness to experiment said Peter Daou who was Clinton s Web guru during her presidential run They are starting to push the envelope What remains unclear though is whether the spike in interest reflects the revamped Web site or the public s fascination with Clinton s latest career shift The personality behind it can t be dismissed said Daou who now blogs on human rights and other issues for U N Dispatch http www undispatch com Like Obama Clinton carries a Blackberry but she is not allowed to use it on the department s secure seventh floor where her office is Aides say she takes an active role in answering questions from the Web responding to bloggers and pushing her agency s new media agenda The United States Government is behind nearly everybody except in certain discrete areas in terms of technology she told department employees at a town hall meeting in We are in my view wasting time wasting money wasting opportunities because we are not prepared to communicate effectively with what is out there in the business world and the private world Clinton was quick to embrace new media at the start of her presidential campaign She announced her entry the race in on the Web and followed with regular Internet chats and Internet fundraising appeals Nonetheless Clinton was surpassed by the Obama campaign s mastery of the Internet and social networking sites Obama used the Web to raise record donations and identify and orchestrate an army of volunteers Clinton was first lady when the first White House Web site debuted in It was a bare bones operation compared with what is available now Three years later the State Department went online during Secretary of State Madeleine s tenure But it wasn t until under Secretary of State Condoleezza s spokesman Sean McCormack that the department s public affairs shop began exploring new media in earnest McCormack started the Dipnote blog which some foreign service veterans predicted would fail given the private and stuffy nature of diplomacy The site endured under Clinton has retooled Dipnote with a Twitter feed and a broader range of posts from diplomats It s more than just window dressing This past week diplomats used Twitter to tweet down false rumors they feared might lead to a siege on the U S Embassy in Madagascar On her first two foreign trips to Asia and then the Middle East and Europe local bloggers were embedded with the traveling press corps broadening the audience for Clinton s official meetings and public appearances which often produce more personal than policy questions On her question site Clinton has responded to a varied questions from Should the U S engage in direct dialogue with Hamas to How did you like meeting the Japanese students By the end of Clinton s trip to the Mideast her text the secretary feature had received nearly text messages On both trips Clinton also participated in Webcasts One in Beijing on climate change generated more than million page views more than comments and questions according to the statistics Clinton s staff say they plan to venture further the realm of social networking an animated online world called Second Life and cell phone technology The department hopes to follow through on a Bush administration organized project that brought together Facebook Google Howcast YouTube AT T MTV Columbia Law School Access Media and Gen Next for an Alliance of Youth Movements summit It also wants to expand on X Life a mobile phone game launched in that is aimed at helping youth in the Middle East learn English and teaching them about American

For others a place of historic and cultural ties For all of us a test of collective commitment and resolve Some may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today Why countries in the Western Hemisphere Europe the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to Haiti in the midst of a global economic downturn that has shaken us all We re gathered at this conference because what happens in Haiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond the Americas The success or failure of this one small nation has economic social and political implications not just for its million citizens but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economic recovery political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port au Prince The United States is here first and foremost because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend Our ties to Haiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations through our struggles for independence through the defeat of slavery in Haiti which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U S to press on with their fight for freedom and more recently through the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who emigrated to the United States and strengthened it through their contributions in politics business science sports and culture the benefits of which I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York We are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation no matter their present level of wealth or current political circumstances is moving in the same direction toward greater peace prosperity freedom and opportunity With Haiti we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people who are seeking to march forward A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning to reap dividends in economic growth wider access to health care stronger governmental institutions greater safety and security and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people s lives improve Today Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere with one of the region s biggest gaps between the haves and have nots But in Haiti had its highest economic growth since the s It is on track to reach the completion point for the IMF s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months which means significant debt relief is on the way which will free up approximately million a month money that Haiti can invest directly in improving the lives of its people and building a future of self sufficiency and confidence Haiti has the region s highest rate of HIV AIDS the highest rate of maternal mortality and the highest rate of child mortality But the numbers of HIV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down Not long ago Haiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship But the national and presidential elections in jump started Haiti s democracy and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strong commitment to democratic governance which will take another step forward on with elections for the Senate Like many nations including the United States Haiti struggles against crime particularly the global scourge of drug trafficking But reforms to improve policing strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway and a peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities Haiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here today And this progress did not come only through government to government partnerships but also through links among businesses universities NG s religious and cultural groups and individuals the full range of resources and relationships which is the heart of smart power That trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession Haiti is in danger of stalling This conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team with Haiti at the helm to advance a comprehensive long term strategy for Haiti s growth by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts targeting clear goals and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track With these priorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner we can make high impact investments that will help lay the foundation for stronger democratic institutions a vibrant civil society and an open market economy that creates more stability attracts international investment and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a whole Now is the time to step up our investment in Haiti not because the situation is so dire but because the consequences of inaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road With we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five That s a tiny fraction of the cost of solving these problems if they escalate over time The United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested which are aimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress First the Haitian people need to be secure They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the civic lives of their communities without fear of violence Second the country needs stronger infrastructure particularly roads which are the circulatory system of any robust economy Meanwhile the people of Haiti are ready to work but jobs are in short supply We can accomplish two things at once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti And third last year s hurricanes blew a hole in the government s budget Now Haiti is facing a huge deficit which will make it harder to provide services in the short term or fund major projects in the long term Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future On each of these issues security jobs and infrastructure and debt relief the United States is lending its assistance and seeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact First security Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti Cite Soleil for example was a no man s land for years but today violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in the streets The Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti which is the first in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated Brazil has led the mission with determination and skill This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region But criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have made this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States Canada and Europe Drug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade That includes the United States We will give million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative a plan conceived by Mexico Central America and the United States This money will fund a secure communications network for the Haitian police provide a maritime base vehicles and operational support for police drug units provide training to promote cross border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic and sharpen the investigation and prosecution of drug crimes Once security is established opportunity can take root Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous assistance to help repair the damage from last year s storms Now it is time to take the next step to move beyond peacekeeping and disaster relief to long term reconstruction and development Haiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere percent of its people don t have jobs It also has one of the region s highest population growth rates Together these trends have created what one development expert has called a youth tsunami nearly million youths are expected to come the job market in the next five years To spur the creation of jobs the United States passed the HOPE Act in to give garments made in Haiti tariff free access to the U S market Last we extended this trade preference for another decade Apparel is one of the largest sectors in Haiti s economy We see great potential for job creation in this field and we are gratified by Brazil s interest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well But to build a diversified economy Haiti needs more than trade deals It also needs the infrastructure to support the flow of goods and services The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate many communities are isolated by the lack of a passable road which prevents people from holding jobs children from going to school and farmers from bringing their crops to market Better roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians the global economy Haiti also needs better roads in tourist areas to promote that sector of the economy Other urgent infrastructure needs include digging water catchments to prevent floods completing a garment workers training center and creating canals to help irrigation As part of the million in non emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year we have authorized million in aid to generate jobs to help people put their skills to work building their country s future We look forward to working with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively to trigger a virtuous circle for long term economic growth All the fiscal responsibility in the world can t prevent a natural disaster The hurricanes didn t just wash away crops and houses they also washed away months of government planning for the future Haiti is facing an approximately million budget deficit which could undermine Haiti s long term ambitions as well as services that people depend on to survive The United States will provide million to pay Haiti s upcoming debt service obligations to free Haiti to use its resources to fill that budget gap There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve The combined effect of rising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to malnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity Malnourished people are often too weak to work chronically hungry children struggle to learn in school Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering but a direct threat to economic growth and global stability The United States will provide a million in kind contribution of food to help Haiti as it continues to rebuild These are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with Haiti and other nations But there are additional pieces of the larger mission that need support from helping Haiti adapt to climate change so future hurricanes won t claim thousands of lives to strengthening health systems promoting sustainable agriculture and developing civil society This work is not only a matter for governments but also a mission for our people Here in the U S I have heard from many individuals and groups who care about Haiti and want to help it develop but don t know how to invest their time and money in a way that will make a real impact We should think creatively about helping people outside government get involved in a meaningful way with Haiti s future Our people are our most valuable resource and their potential to help in places like Haiti has not yet been tapped We know from empirical data that small investments go a long way This is something I ve seen for myself in my own visits to Haiti I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding and again years later as First Lady I met a doctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U S Air Force Colonel but returned to his home town of Pignon to run a center for health women s literacy and microcredit He and his staff had few resources but they offered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients I visited a family planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect their health and prevent teen pregnancy And I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy These women had attended a global conference on women s leadership in Montevideo Uruguay and when they returned home they created this organization to support Haitian women running for office Eleven years later their organization is larger and stronger than ever and so is their mission In addition to supporting women candidates they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs run civic education programs to teach women their rights support women journalists and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean These Haitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind And they demonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the Haitian people to participate in and lead their nation s recovery Our role is to support their work however we can and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future is as important as our own What happens next in Haiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on of every poor nation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months On of every man and woman in the hemisphere from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip of Argentina who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards and the children whose futures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control let us prove our commitment to an economic recovery that reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere
1067,FW: Great Wpost article,As is often the case I have to read in the paper what is up to rather than learn it at home but perhaps I wouldn t have it any other way cdm brifibinoton Post NEWSI POLITICSI OPINIONSI BUSINESSI LOCAL SPORTSI ARTS LIVING I GOING OUT GUIDE I JOBSI CARSI REAL ESTATE SHOPPING School of Second Chances The teachers at Oak Academy approach their jobs with the faith that even the most hardened juvenile delinquents can achieve and the knowledge that many still won t By Karen Houppert W The six teenage boys incarcerated at the District s Oak juvenile detention facility in Laurel file their classroom after lunch one late afternoon They are surprised to see strangers five women and two men sitting in the chairs that the boys typically occupy The students find some empty seats and shrug out of their matching brown coats and mismatched scarves They are curious about the visitors in a lean back fold your arms prove it kind of way I m Forman begins a something man I m a professor at Georgetown Law School and You related to the Forman interrupts year old Carleto Bailey I m Forman Jr That your father Forman your dad Carleto demands Yes I Wasn t he some big civil rights guy NAACP Or SNCC SNCC Forman says seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father who was executive secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the s before becoming active with the Black Panthers B He s a good guy Carleto continues You tell him that Forman smiles He passed a few years ago but he would be happy to hear this the professor says He scans the room The Oak students all African American are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal blue polo shirts They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and after sitting down have pushed their chairs back as far as possible against the wall Forman s Georgetown law students African American Arab Latino Caucasian are in jeans and sweaters They lean forward intent and maybe a little bit nervous I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school Forman continues And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenile justice There is a certain amount you can learn from reading but you also need to see and experience things So I thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences Carleto raises an eyebrow This is a new one And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don t Ya ll have certain things you know They have certain things they know It can be a learning opportunity for everybody Forman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves Dead silence He smiles encouragingly My name is Forman and I helped to start this organization See Forever that now runs your school he says Carleto who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair brings it down with a bang that sends his short dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose A few Georgetown students jump He looks out over the top of his glasses My name s Carleto Bailey he says My interesting fact is that I m funny I He gives a wide smile of bright white teeth The Georgetown students laugh Oak student Ashawntea Henderson who sits next to him rolls his eyes But Carleto s not done And I m smart But as it turns out these Georgetown folks like his other teachers at Oak Academy aren t going to accept Carleto s assertion at face value They want more than good grades more than the right answers on a multiple choice test They want him to prove that he can think Forman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New York s Rikers Island Afterward the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference It s a hard question Inmates Residents Scholars one of them asks Does it matter what you re called Carleto studies the woman s face to discern what she wants to hear back It is blank He struggles Not so much he says finally He looks at her She seems unconvinced He worries that he has given the wrong answer and tries again Back in the community there are certain police patrols in the neighborhood who say I know what you re up to When we come home some of us are trying to do right but they basically criticize us because you re already labeled What are the labels Forman asks This one is easy for Carleto He sinks down in his chair and throws it out Trouble he says Carleto Bailey is trouble He is also as he rightly noted smart But he has arrived at Oak Academy with a few disadvantages He has been poorly educated in the D C public schools was frequently truant and has had multiple run ins with the law The D C Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services which runs Oak won t release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile but we do know this is Carleto s second time at the detention center His academic knowledge is spotty at best He can tell you who Forman is but not where the comma falls in a letter s greeting Dear Fidel he writes in a mock letter to Castro during English class He is a fairly typical Oak scholar And once upon a time he would have been written off But today staff at the fledgling Oak Academy are determined to view the kids captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes in their education Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi director of Youth Rehabilitation Services the school opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth What would happen Oak Academy co founders Forman and Domenici wondered if you seduced these kids with content that was meaningful to them What would happen if they had lots of good caring teachers in small classrooms What if one assumed the kids could learn and behaved as such In other words what would happen if the District s most challenged students got a private school education albeit on a campus of a decidedly different nature The bottom line says Domenici is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming but they ve gotten the worst It is this conviction that drove Domenici who is also the school s principal and Forman to create three public charter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past years Called the Maya Angelou schools the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles Students attend small classes taught by specially trained staff The high school day stretches from a m to p m with three meals provided Some kids whose home lives prove too chaotic for study are offered supervised housing in the neighborhood And it works Last year percent of Maya Angelou graduates were accepted two or four year colleges Domenici says According to the District s Office of the State Superintendent of Education percent of students who enter ninth grade in D C public schools and city charter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within months of graduating high school It is a good model But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court involved youth about percent of Maya Angelou students had spent some time at Oak working inside the gates posed a new set of challenges Youth Rehabilitation Services has been under a court monitor for years due in part to a history of abuse and poor conditions When Schiraldi took over the department in and began his reform efforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak he saw immediately that changing the school was essential How could I look at my staff at Oak and say we are about excellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from to every day Schiraldi says Kids sat and watched movies all day Little if any teaching was going on Schiraldi says It was a miserable miserable school Schiraldi immediately began lobbying the D C Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate the school and as soon as he got the okay he put out a request for proposals Domenici and Forman submitted a plan that Schiraldi says blew the other ones out of the water and in were awarded a million contract to run the school for the next three years Domenici s and Forman s partnership is a somewhat unlikely one Domenici is the son of former New Mexico Republican senator Pete Domenici He went to Stanford Law School worked in corporate law for a few years and then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford who was the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist Forman who graduated from Yale Law School worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day O Connor and as a D C public defender After seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had he joined forces with Domenici whom he met through a mutual friend to start an independent school for students in A year later it became part of the first Maya Angelou public charter school At Oak Academy principal Domenici fights with an occasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics functioning boilers permission for a college tour for a group of six students classes uninterrupted by corrections staff who sometimes will call three quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take their meds Forman is chairman of the Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board member of its parent group the See Forever Foundation He attacks hurdles from the other side fundraising and advocating for juvenile justice reform When came out to run the school here it was like Ocean s Go find all the people you can trust from your previous mission Forman jokes That included past colleagues and even a few Maya Angelou graduates Samantha Crandal Simpore who had been at a then coed Oak herself when she was on an accessory assault charge went to a Maya Angelou school and now runs the Oak Academy welcome center I tell them I was here too Simpore says She tells each new student about how she was years old and didn t know her multiplication tables how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman hoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables I say You re at an intersection in your life You know what s down the street behind you Nothing you can do about that But you have a choice about what s up the road ahead Many of the Oak students ranging in age from to come in performing way below grade level and nearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities They are at Oak for an average of months cycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine month academic year Out of necessity they are grouped according to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate Thirteen year olds can be in classes with year olds More than half have been committed to Oak for violent felonies Fights are common Before the month is out Carleto will get a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his release date Through the use of small classes typically five to teens work with one teacher a teaching assistant and a guard the school organizes the curriculum around four week themes designed to pique students curiosity and get them to think critically about the nature of democracy social justiCe and their role in the world For example during the Relationship theme students parse the types of relationships ranging from those between humans and the natural world ancient river civilizations to those between individuals and groups Pharaohs and their subjects to those between humans and ideas liberation theology At the same time in English class students will be working on the standard five paragraph essay via the guiding question Why do relationships matter and how can relationships be both good and bad for people With the current unit Change the D C public school system s learning standards are woven the social studies curriculum under loose headings such as Changes in the Way Humans Think About the World and Their Place in It which becomes a way of introducing the scientific revolution the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta It s a philosophy that emphasizes learning through making cross discipline connections long popular in affluent progressive schools but typically eschewed in schools for underprivileged kids where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule Oak Academy has also created a course called Advocacy which the Georgetown law students are co teaching emphasizing this month s theme Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy is essential to teaching them to be good citizens We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self advocate or advocate on of a community Domenici says We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that our democracy demands But this is an ambitious agenda and Oak Academy faces significant obstacles Can you teach teens to think critically when they re missing the basic underpinnings of education How do you teach empowerment in a setting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving Although he sometimes grows discouraged Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learn that one of their most promising students got a fight on the unit or graduated from the program only to commit another crime and be sent back I talk to staff about the fact that day to day our job is to do the absolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control he says reminding them that they don t control all the pieces of the puzzle And if you do that well you have done the moral and just thing His staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities First knowledge is power and through possessing it every student is capable of success And absent the right support failure lurks right around the corner It sounds like this I think Carleto has a good chance of finishing high school and going on to college Domenici says Pause Also he is highly at risk of not doing that It is a cold day in late and Oak is in the midst of the four week session on change Dressed in jeans a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket the heat s not working Oak social studies teacher Adams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto who is doodling on a piece of paper at his desk Pay attention he says taking Carleto s pencil Carleto what is today s essential question What is historical change and how is it different from other kinds of change Carleto says reading from the board where Adams has scrawled his topic Yes Adams says He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly until the student snatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway A youth development specialist which is how corrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of the room But she snatches the hat from mid air scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket Please sit Adams tells the student Not quite sitting not quite standing the student perches on the edge of Adams s desk Good enough Adams continues What s the difference between personal change and historical change Silence Anybody More silence Ashawntea Historical change is like a revolution Ashawntea says Adams throws out a list of changes getting a raise in salary moving to a new house the election of President Obama and Carleto accurately sorts the changes micro and macro personal and historical Obama s campaign was all about change Adams says Do you think he is talking historical change He wants the students to think about the president who has been in office now for two days What might his first days look like he asks the students What advice would you offer him Carleto looks stumped Just throw out some ideas Adams prompts He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters to the president advising him on how to set his agenda for change Carleto slaps his pencil down on the desk Obama s not reading our letters he says He folds his arms across his chest skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter and skeptical perhaps that the teachers really want to hear his ideas Later Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president as he is reading Barack Obama s Dreams From My Father It started off as a good book but it got excellent he says He struggles hard to articulate the book s themes and appeal I don t know how to put it he says finally but growing up with no disrespect but a Caucasian mom and an African father he still made it through Sitting in a guard s room off the gym on a evening the echoing sound of classmates bouncing basketballs around the cavernous gym Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story As a child he was very fun happy as far as kindergarten through sixth grade Starting in first grade he was on the honor roll and was also making it to school every day he says beginning in third person but quickly lapsing first In the late stages of middle school at the end of eighth grade I started smoking weed doing stuff I wasn t supposed to be doing He takes full responsibility No one peer pressured me or anything I was liking what was going on when I was high he explains He like almost all the teens at Oak denies being involved in a gang Still Carleto says that his best friend since elementary school was killed in th grade in a neighborhood thing Nowadays anyone can just ride up on you and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot he says explaining that his buddy was shot because of a miscommunication It wasn t intended for us he says insisting that he and his friend nicknamed Smoke were just waiting for the bus Then he announces I don t want to talk about it So he doesn t though it clearly haunts him He will doodle R I P Smoke on the cover of his blue folder or on a piece of loose leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard He s happy to talk about Oak Academy though where he has a grade point average after six months Domenici says Carleto is in the top percent of students at Oak and tests fairly high on assessments Carleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him being a senior in with freshman He complains that the classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is getting warmed up That really bugs him but he doesn t say much He says that he will be leaving Oak in two months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak s transition center in the District from which he says he will graduate this When he gets out there are a couple of things he wants to do right off he says First he intends to see his girlfriend then go out to a restaurant and then go to the Adidas shop in Georgetown where my mom will get me some stuff and my dad too He says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak She was I m going to say she was kind of like surprised at my actions what I done Carleto says You know how they say Whatever hides in the dark comes out She was not ashamed of me but disappointed in me Meanwhile she makes the long minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit Every weekend both days he says He is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life He has four brothers ages and and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom He says his mom works as a secretary but he struggles to remember where She was working with what s that program downtown by the Washington Monument dealing with Smokey the Bear I m trying to think It s right by the Holocaust Museum It s a brick building She works there Later Carleto s school case worker Essence will offer a somewhat different account of Carleto s life Although Carleto is in th grade he will not graduate in as he says He is still six credits shy says And it will be at least three months not two before his release Carleto s father is not part of his life says The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to Oak His mother who has a rap sheet dating to has been in and out of jail for years arrested repeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors including possession and distribution of drugs as well as prostitution She has been in prison since serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for assault with a dangerous weapon attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail She is not visiting Carleto on weekends By the end of still in the midst of the unit on change the Oak teens file their advocacy class jostling each other edgy It is unseasonably warm outside and they do not want to be here Reluctantly they take their seats and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison yard visible through the door someone has wedged open Occasionally a breeze wafts the room Today the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement If youths of color are percent of the general population in the United States but percent of the prison population this is disproportionate minority confinement the law students explain They refer the teens to a handout each has on the desk in front of him an article excerpt from New American Media Racism of the Juvenile Justice System Revealed to explain that this isn t simply because people of color commit more crimes African American youths are times more likely and Latinos times more likely than white youths to be detained for identical offenses About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally charged and drawn the system Only one quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar break Although youth of color are percent of Oak s population of inmates and indeed percent of all juvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city disproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp Georgetown student Abby Fee tries a pie graph a bar graph a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os Blank stares Then it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they re talking about Hey he says suddenly sitting forward They re switched around Basically there s more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles even though there s more of them Yes Fee says So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system Ashavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over Fee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons behind these figures They have prepared a role playing game to coax the teens thinking about this from different perspectives Then they want the students to practice advocating for change So we re going to have three roles Fee says dividing the teens pairs One group is a year old one group is playing a math teacher and one group is playing a city council member Carleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on reforming the police department Carleto doesn t want to be a city council member He doesn t even want to be here today He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T shirt He puts his glasses on then takes them off How could you maintain better relationships with police Fee asks settling herself a chair to help Carleto and his partner work through this Carleto throws his pencil down on the table Won t answer She asks again Silence Finally he offers a sullen challenge Stop harassing people for no reason How do you want them to treat people Equally he says He picks up the pencil and tap tat taps it on the desk Fee tries to get him to be more specific Don t arrest for small problems Instead take them home and tell your family what you re doing Carleto s partner says unconsciously slipping second person And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general Fee prods A long pause Could be their minds are whirring busily could be they re spacing out Fee a teacher before enrolling at Georgetown takes it in stride She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question Don t have or cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car Carleto says Patrol each ward equally asks Fee Carleto writes that down then adds I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain t right Fee nods encourages him to write it down Carleto s partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes The majority of police shouldn t carry guns I could say The majority of police are racist But how would you fix that Fee prods A camera on their car to catch them if they re doing it but a secret one Carleto suggests He sits up straighter in his chair And don t just pull over people because they re black They can say anything that s the reason why I pulled you over because your headlights are off or whatever Suddenly Carleto is on a roll and he rattles off a list of improvements Call to order of the city council says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi Carleto and his partner stand in the front of the class Hello I m Mr and I am a city councilman Carleto says glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand We have some complaints from the different communities and wards about police and these are some of our suggestions about cracking down on officers He sounds nervous as he begins the list Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic youths and treat them equal to the same race that you are Also police don t arrest if there is a situation at the school like a fight or anything I feel they should not be arrested but taken home Then tell their parents why this happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police He moves briskly through the suggestions and twice tentatively tries actually making eye contact with the audience In conclusion he says verbally abusing youth won t be tolerated any more Basically we want to crack down on the officers and have them removed if so Another pair of students rises to begin a presentation but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard s walkie talkie Time to go the guard announces The law students are surprised they are not quite done but politely acquiesce Wait Ashawntea says standing up We got more minutes It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on the guard says But we have minutes Carleto insists He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms It s only We got more minutes still The guard takes a beat then shrugs and concedes Carleto s point He goes back out the hall to wait Carleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise His advocacy worked Yesss Ashawntea hisses under his breath Karen Houppert is a contributing writer for the Magazine She can be reached at me karenhouppert

1221,In case you missed this,This was on Krugman s blog yesterday I for one enjoyed it Hope you re very well Hillary am Ahem Politico Health care could soon go the way of the automobile with users having no choice but to buy insurance coverage Within four years every American could be required to own health insurance or pay their way through tax penalties The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and Republican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance Committee considered the so called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs for those who already have coverage President Barack Obama didn t embrace the individual mandate during the campaign which means he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters The mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton who argued that a mandate was the only way to achieve universal coverage Obama disagreed saying enough people would purchase insurance voluntarily if the costs could be brought down Progressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama s plan would have left out about million people Clinton with an assist from New York Times columnist Krugman regularly assailed Obama for his no mandate position Actually I don t care who gets credit as long as we actually get universal health care

1331,last email on this subject,Sorry to flood your email but I couldn t resist sending this to you from Ben A year later Hillary wins A year ago today the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won the primary and Hillary Clinton lost it There s far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary but it does seem worth noting one particular piece of news in its light On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary which was to be fair conducted within a fairly narrow frame Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely to more closely resemble Clinton s In a dense careful letter to Ted Kennedy and Max Baucus Obama offered his principles for a health care plan and conceded on a central point He is now open to an individual mandate which he campaigned against and which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword shared responsibility Obama still backs a hardship waiver for people unable to afford the mandate which is consistent with the core of his objection to the mandate But what he cast as a principled difference of approach was the problem merely that people couldn t afford insurance or something more seems to have been conceded Here s the relevant paragraph I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility making every American responsible for having health insurance coverage and asking that employers share in the cost I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone s costs and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance we must make health care affordable If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it In addition while I believe that employers have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees small businesses face a number of special challenges in affording health benefits and should be exempted B B By Ben PM

1346,Concept Paper for World Food Prize Remarks - Attached and Below (Drafted by,am x CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger connect it to an array of global issues including economic development health and education expanding opportunity for women and political stability and declare the Administration s commitment to tackling hunger at its roots through effective and efficient collaboration with an array of partners Additionally your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local solutions and focus on long term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for emergency assistance down the road The speech could be framed as follows THE PRIZE AND PRIZE WINNER You can begin by announcing the winner of the World Food Prize Dr Gebisa Ejeta He has a remarkable story born in a mud hut in Ethiopia he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and developed strains of sorghum that are drought tolerant high yield and resistant to the Striga weed which devastates crops across Africa Outside the lab he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry developed systems to produce certify and market hybrid seeds and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation And he has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE Dr Ejeta s work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it one that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed the fields where small scale farmers labor to feed their families and make a living the markets where food is bought and sold and the homes where people get the nourishment they need to thrive In many places that food chain is broken One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will go to sleep hungry tonight Chronic hunger threatens health while making it harder for people to work and students to learn which in turn stunts economic development Last year s food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce political stability is threatened To date the world s primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid While this saves lives it is a short term fix and we need a long term solution The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach We will support the creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world to increase agricultural productivity create jobs strengthen economies and protect natural resources We will do this not by imposing one size fits all solutions but by assisting countries in carrying out individual strategies that meet their needs for example through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan To facilitate coordination and share best practices we will seek to convene donor governments multilateral institutions NG s private companies foundations universities and individuals THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH We ve identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems These will guide our approach Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds fertilizer irrigation the credit to purchase them and the training to use them Stimulate the post harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving transportation to connect small farmers to markets Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well the future and we can make the right adaptations for the changing environment Expand knowledge and training by support R D and developing the next generation of agriculture scientists Increase trade so small scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide Support policy reform and good governance because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and predictable policy and regulatory environment Support women and families in agriculture Seventy percent of the world s farmers are women but most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men This must change for agriculture to thrive And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities future A PREVIEW OF WHAT S TO COME In the coming weeks President Obama Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to global coordination and agriculture in greater detail We will seek the input wisdom and guidance of those who have been working so long in this arena from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the private sector The President s conversations at the G meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our approach as well as my trip to Africa in Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery stabilizing societies and expanding opportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide This is why supporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration CONCLUSION You can circle back to the story of Dr Ejeta to close He represents the need for a multinational approach born in Ethiopia educated in the United States advised by Indian scientists advisor to several African nations x CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger connect it to an array of global issues including economic development health and education expanding opportunity for women and political stability and declare the Administration s commitment to tackling hunger at its roots through effective and efficient collaboration with an array of partners Additionally your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local solutions and focus on long term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for emergency assistance down the road The speech could be framed as follows THE PRIZE AND PRIZE WINNER You can begin by announcing the winner of the World Food Prize Dr Gebisa Ejeta He has a remarkable story born in a mud hut in Ethiopia he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and developed strains of sorghum that are drought tolerant high yield and resistant to the Striga weed which devastates crops across Africa Outside the lab he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry developed systems to produce certify and market hybrid seeds and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation And he has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE Dr Ejeta s work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it one that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed the fields where small scale farmers labor to feed their families and make a living the markets where food is bought and sold and the homes where people get the nourishment they need to thrive In many places that food chain is broken One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will go to sleep hungry tonight Chronic hunger threatens health while making it harder for people to work and students to learn which in turn stunts economic development Last year s food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce political stability is threatened To date the world s primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid While this saves lives it is a short term fix and we need a long term solution The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach We will support the creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world to increase agricultural productivity create jobs strengthen economies and protect natural resources We will do this not by imposing one size fits all solutions but by assisting countries in carrying out individual strategies that meet their needs for example through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan To facilitate coordination and share best practices we will seek to convene donor governments multilateral institutions NG s private companies foundations universities and individuals THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH We ve identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems These will guide our approach Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds fertilizer irrigation the credit to purchase them and the training to use them Stimulate the post harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving transportation to connect small farmers to markets Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well the future and we can make the right adaptations for the changing environment Expand knowledge and training by support R D and developing the next generation of agriculture scientists Increase trade so small scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide Support policy reform and good governance because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and predictable policy and regulatory environment Support women and families in agriculture Seventy percent of the world s farmers are women but most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men This must change for agriculture to thrive And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities future A PREVIEW OF WHAT S TO COME In the coming weeks President Obama Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to global coordination and agriculture in greater detail We will seek the input wisdom and guidance of those who have been working so long in this arena from the Congress to NGOs to academics

1417,Kurtzer,Just wanted to be sure you saw the Kurtzer op ed which ran in the Post Kudos to Jonathan Prince for getting this written and placed The Settlements Facts By Kurtzer Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact Charles Krauthanuner s column The Settlements Myth is one example Here are the facts In the Israeli government accepted with some reservations the road map for peace which imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements GO Government of Israel immediately dismantles settlement outposts erected since Consistent with the Report GOI freezes all settlement activity including natural growth of settlements Today Israel maintains that three events namely draft understandings discussed in between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and U S deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley President W Bush s letter to Sharon and an letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security adviser Condoleezza constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing Israeli building within the construction line of settlements The problem is that there was no such understanding The first event the Israelis cite is the discussions on a four part draft that included the notion that construction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built up areas of the settlements The idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built up areas in settlements and to allow building only inside that line This draft was never codified and no effort was made then to define the line around the built up areas of settlements Nonetheless Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of these provisions probably believing that U S silence conferred assent Second President Bush s letter conveyed U S support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which Israel would retain existing major Israeli population centers in the West Bank on the basis of mutually agreed changes One of the key provisions of this letter was that U S support for Israel s retaining some settlements was predicated on there being an agreed outcome of negotiations Despite Israel s contention that this letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion the letter did not convey any U S support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or other areas in the run up to a peace agreement In his letter to Weissglas addressed the issue of the construction line saying that within the agreed principles of settlement activities an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition of the construction line of settlements in Judea Samaria However there never were any agreed principles of settlement activities Moreover the effort to define the construction line was never consummated Israel and the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of settlements Weissglas s letter also promised continuous action to remove all the unauthorized outposts but Israel removed almost none of them Throughout this period the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel s continuing settlement activity But this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it In recent days former senior Bush administration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding continued settlement activity Commentators also focus on the Obama administration s reiteration that a freeze must include the natural growth of settlements Krauthammer says that this means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the armistice line It means no increase in population Which means no babies This is nonsense No one suggests that Israelis stop having babies Rather the blessing of a new baby does not translate a right to build more apartments or houses in settlements The two issues have nothing to do with each other Israelis like Americans move all the time when life circumstances children jobs housing availability change The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural growth argument Since when Israel signed the Oslo Accords Israel s West Bank settler population has grown from to The numbers in East Jerusalem increased from to more than This goes far beyond the natural increase of families already living in the settlements Inserting the provision of natural growth in official documents started with the Report and the road map reflecting recognition that the concept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements The Obama administration is pursuing policies that every administration since has articulated that settlements jeopardize the possibility of achieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop This does not diminish the Palestinians responsibilities especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure President Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech But Palestinian failures in no way justify Israeli failure to implement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts It is time for Israel to freeze all settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts The writer US ambassador to Israel from to is a visiting professor of Middle East policy studies at Princeton University s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International

1438,fYi,FYI Gary Sick s latest analysis on Iran below posted on his blog Sick has independent sources and is very well informed Is this another Iranian revolution To someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of with fascination developments in Iran today have an eerie reminiscence Then there were massive protests that filled the streets often marching in dignified but ominous silence there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced determined but unarmed crowds there were sullen mourning parades there were catchy chants and ritual calls of Down with the shah at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar You need only change shah to dictator and you have a description of what is happening in Iran today But there is one very big difference Thirty years ago Iran had a charismatic cleric named Ayatollah Khomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause he represented On the other side was Mohammed Reza who had been on the throne for some years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world On the surface it appeared to be an uneven battle guns against turbans but the ruler with the guns wavered and the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed Today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical Mir Hossein Mousavi who is notably lacking in personal charisma On the other side is the constitutional Leader Ayatollah IChamene i who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his religious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system and the institutions most loyal to him particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful security forces including the Revolutionary Guards Neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces let alone the situation The fraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event but the energy behind these unprecedented demonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by the regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi Yesterday Mousavi ordered that people stay home in face of a conflicting pro regime demonstration They marched anyway and the daughter of former president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on Mousavi then ordered everyone to march the following day which they were probably going to do with or without his orders IChamene i announced the divine assessment of the election outcome even before it would probably have been physically possible to count the more than million ballots Then in the face of mass protests he ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian Council the same organization that was responsible for managing the election in the first place No one believed him in either case and no one expected anything of importance from the Guardian Council Khamene i has ordered peace and reconciliation No one paid any attention I deliberately did not mention president elect Ahmadinejad After celebrating his victory he went off to a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow He seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passive player than a major actor in these events So who is calling the shots Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd not leading it But that is probably all that is required to keep the protest in motion On the other side the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being made by the ultra conservative leadership of the Revolutionary Guards whose political role has ballooned over the past decade perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy They are utterly ruthless and ideologically fueled New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago see blog item on below at the end of the day as I saw at Tiananmen years ago when Might and Right do battle it s often prudent to bet on Might at least in the short run The regime seems to have miscalculated badly They seemed to believe that a sudden coup the announcement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force would intimidate and silence the opposition and consolidate their control That is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were being made by military leaders who tend to see the battle in Manichaean terms rather than politicians such as IChamene i who are accustomed to seeing shades of gray In any event it b ackfired and they now have a much larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for Ahmadinejad to win by a slim margin which was at least believable All parties are now in uncharted territory A significant portion of the Iranian population seems to have concluded that their social contract with the rulers accepting Islamic rule in return for a respectful regard for the opinion of the governed an Islamic Republic is no longer valid They do not trust their rulers The rulers whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of the country are increasingly replacing popular support with repression This election seems to have called that tactic question For the military the obvious answer is more repression So it would appear to be a moment to bet on Might But nobody is fully in command of events Decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and could determine the future path of the Iranian revolution There is another lesson as Iran s leaders contemplate a Tiananmen moment When the Tiananmen crackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago one of the leaders of China at the time was Zhao Ziyang General Secretary of the Communist Party He was later fired and placed under house arrest His smuggled memoirs have just appeared revealing the depth of disagreements within the lea dership about how to proceed Is it possible that ten years from now we will have a volume describing the intense debates that one can only presume are underway today in the highest councils of the Islamic Republic of Iran Dell Days of Deals A New Deal

1439,here's juan cole you may not have seen. Sid,Day of Mourning Protests Called by Mousavi on Mir Hosain Mousavi who maintains he won last s presidential election despite official assertions that he lost to to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is calling for another rally this time in part to honor the persons killed by hardliners or security forces in the course of previous demonstrations Mourning the martyr is as central to Iranian Shiite religious culture as it was to strains of medieval Catholicism in Europe and Mousavi s camp is tapping a powerful set of images and myths here The archetypal Shiite martyr is Imam Husayn the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad who championed oppressed Muslims in Iraq and was cut down by the then Umayyad Muslim Empire Redognition that a Muslim state might commit the ultimate in sacrilege by beheading a person who had been dangled on the Prophet s knee has imbued modern political Shiism with a distrust of the state When Husayn s head was brought to the Umayyad caliph Yazid and deposited before his throne older companions of the Prophet are said to have wept and remarked I saw the Prophet s lips on those cheeks Shiites ritually march flagellate and chant in honor of the martyred Imam or divinely appointed leader Today s protesters are wearing green which symbolizes Mousavi s descent from the Prophet Muhammad Mousavi s family name refers to the Seventh Imam descendant of the Prophet with claims to divine knowledge Musa Kazim whose tomb is in Kazimiya north Sayyid families those claiming descent from the Prophet often take one of the Imams names as a family name to honor them though of course they are also claiming descent from the previous Imams right back to the Prophet The repertoires of protest the reformists are using echo those of the Islamic Revolution they are chanting God is Great mourning pious fallen martyrs etc another sign that this movement is not just alienated secularized elites But now Mousavi s his supporters are also sporting black ribbons to indicate that they are in mourning for the fallen Typically the dead will be commemorated again at one month and at days In such demonstrations for those killed in previous demonstrations grew in size all through the year till they reached an alleged million in the streets of Tehran Since the reformists are already claiming s rally was a million you wonder where things will go from here The regime s attempt to paint the protesters as nothing more than US intelligence agents underlines how wise President Obama has been not to insert himself forcefully the situation in Iran The reformers and the hard liners are not stable groupings The core of each is competing for the allegiance of the general Iranian public If the reformers can convince most Iranians of the justice of their cause they will swing behind the opposition If the hard liners can convince the public that the reformers are nothing more than cat s paws of a grasping imperialist West i e that they are Ahmad Chalabis trying to bring Iran foreign occupation so as to get power themselves then the reformists will be crushed Iranians value national independence above all having suffered with a CIA installed goverment for decades in the mid twentieth century The prescriptions of McCain and Faux Cable news for muscular US diplomacy at this point are tone deaf to Iranian realities and would backfire big time harming both the reform cause and US interests Anyway after the basket case to which the US Republican Party reduced Iraq no one in the global South is likely to want them meddling in their internal affairs Reports are streaming in of the arrest of over a hundred opposition figures and of hard line militia men following protesters home and breaking their homes to terrorize them See e g Basij paramilitary forces terrorize residential complex The Basij militiamen are said to be afraid to come out in numbers during the opposition demonstrations but sneak around at night to trail protesters and harass or arrest them Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had met morning with the representatives of all four presidential candidates urging them to make up but continuing to insist that Alunadinejad was the winner by million to million votes He portrayed the massive post election demonstrations and charges of ballot fraud as a minor tiff Gary Sick wonders if Khamenei really is the supreme leader any more and hints that the hard line tack of stealing the election was directed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps the country s religious national guard Reports are coming in from Iran that allege that the regime is tracking down and destroying satellite dishes using helicopters for aerial surveillance of neighborhoods and Basij the right wing militia sort of like Mussolini s Black Shirts to do the breaking and entering Kindly neighbors who have tried to warn suspected satellite dish owners that the militiamen were coming have sometimes reportedly themselves been arrested Dell Days of Deals A New Deal Everyday

1453,Hillary... few things. Sid,Dear Hillary Hope you are resting comfortably Please take this as an excuse to get much needed rest Lots of people have expressed best wishes for you to me Sean Wilentz Joe Conason Gene Lyons etc so if they haven t contacted you because you re behind a wall you should know that many many people are thinking about you now I spoke this morning to Gary Sick who you recall was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostage crisis and is now at Columbia He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran people experts with extensive contacts and many Iranians deeply embedded in the unfolding events Gary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild mannered reformer to directly challenging the regime Nobody he says knows where this will go certainly not the Iranians Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification plunging the arena as a political player Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto just translated I enclose below Sick s report and analysis on it This poses Sick says a new challenge to Khamenei Does he let it stand Does he answer it Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can t accomplish anything with the regime until the crisis completely works its way out which could take years He points out that the first mass demonstrations against the occurred a full year before his overthrow He adds that the one thing the regime has learned fro m the is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations Two ideas who knows but here they are Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidate control some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy Sick says Obama s statement for example was good He also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon If there would be a UN action shouldn t it focus ont he human rights violence aspect A statement and or resolution urging the regime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias US shouldn t initiate Establish linkage in negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Poland and Czech Republic especially if we plan to give them up with Russian arms sales to Iran Get well See Sick analysis below Sid ousavi s New Revolutionary Manifesto by Gary Sick I am L Alfred Sipa AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached a tipping point today writes Gary Sick the key White House offical during the hostage crisis and what has emerged is nothing short of a platform for a true Islamic democracy Plus read more insight on Iran s election from other Daily Beast writers Today Mir Hossein Mousavi the presidential candidate who has come to represent the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people issued a formal statement Although he denounces the lies and fraud of the leadership particularly in the recent election he views the fraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious He describes a revolution gone wrong a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in forcing an unwanted government on the nation It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi s movement and Mousavi himself have evolved enormously in the past week This moment is a turning point he says and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a historical mission to accomplish nothing less than renewing the life of the nation according to its own ideals He acknowledges interestingly that his own voice at the beginning was less eloquent than he would have wished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green But now he accepts the burden of duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages He denounces both extremes of the political spectrum on one hand those who believe that Islamic government is the same as Tyranny of the Rightful and on the other those who consider religion and Islam to be blockers for realization of republicanism i e those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam Mousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote supervised by an impartial national body is a given right The objective is nothing less than to achieve a new type of political life in the country That is truly a revolutionary statement He says he will stand by the side of all those seeking new solutions in a n on violent way He accepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic Republic including the Revolutionary Guard and the basij but denounces deviations and deceptions He demands reform that returns us to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution He calls for freedom of expression in all its forms and says that if the government permits people to express their views freely there won t be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi s movement and Mousavi himself have evolved enormously in the past week The candidate started as a mild mannered reformer After the searing events of the past several days he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khamene i s lecture on Islamic government Although he never mentions the Leader by name there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments This open opposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented Mousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic Republic The repression and disdain of the government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going And no one knows where any of the parties are likely to go next But for outside observers it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack under your feet Gary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Ford Carter and Reagan He was the principal White House aide for

1455,Best analysis so far of Iranian vote. Sid,Yesterday Chatham House in UK published a detailed study of the Iranian vote concluding from close analysis that the election results were a fraud This is the most definitive objective analysis so far Sid http www chathamhouse org uk files iranelection pdf This paper is published by Chatham House and the Institute of Iranian Studies University of St Andrews Preliminary Analysis of the Voting Figures in Iran s Presidential Election Editor Professor Ali Ansari Director Institute of Iranian Studies University of St Andrews Associate Fellow Middle East and North Africa Programme Chatham House author Iran Islam and Democracy Research and Analysis Berman and Rintoul Institute of Iranian Studies University of St Andrews Chatham House is independent and owes no allegiance to government or to any political body It does not hold opinions of its own the views expressed in this text are the responsibility of the authors This document is issued on the understanding that if any extract is used the authors and Chatham House should be credited preferably with the date of the publication Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran s Presidential Election www chathamhouse org uk Executive Summary Working from the province by province breakdowns of the and results released by the Iranian Ministry of Interior and from the census as published by the official Statistical Centre of Iran the following observations about the official data and the debates surrounding it can be made In two conservative provinces Mazandaran and Yazd a turnout of more than was recorded At a provincial level there is no correlation between the increased turnout and the swing to Ahmadinejad This challenges the notion that Ahmadinejad s victory was due to the massive participation of a previously silent conservative majority In a third of all provinces the official results would require that Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters all former centrist voters and all new voters but also up to of former Reformist voters despite a decade of conflict between these two groups In as in and conservative candidates and Ahmadinejad in particular were markedly unpopular in rural areas That the countryside always votes conservative is a myth The claim that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces flies in the face of these trends Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran s Presidential Election www chathamhouse org uk Irregularities in Voter Turnout Two provinces show a turnout of over and four more show a turnout of over Regional variations in participation have disappeared There is no correlation between the increase in participation and the swing to Ahm adinejad Firstly across the board there is a massive increase in turnout with several provinces increasing their participation rate by nearly This increase results in substantially less variation in turnout between provinces with the standard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling by just over since The results show a substantial turnout gap with seven provinces recording turnout below and ten above In only two were below and were above In fact out of provinces had turnouts within of The data seems to suggest that regional variations in participation have suddenly disappeared This makes the evident lack of any sort of correlation between the provinces that saw an increase in turnout and those that saw a swing to Ahmadinejad Fig all the more unusual There is no significant correlation between the increase in participation for a given province and the swing to Ahmadinejad Fig This lack of correlation makes the argument that an increase in participation by a previously silent conservative majority won the election for Ahmadinejad somewhat problematic Furthermore there are concerns about the numbers themselves Two provinces Mazandaran and Yazd have results which indicate that more votes were cast on than there were eligible voters and that four more provinces had turnouts in the mid nineties In a country where allegations of tombstone voting the practice f using the identity documents of the deceased to cast additional ballots are both longstanding and widespread this result is troubling but perhaps not unexpected This problem did not start with Ahmadinejad according to official statistics gathered by the International institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in Stockholm there were more registered voters at the time of Mohammed Khatami s victory than there were citizens of voting age In conclusion a number of aspects of the reported turnout figures are problematic The massive increases from the collapse of regional variations and the absence of any clear correlation between increases in turnout and increased support for any candidate on their own make the results problematic Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran s Presidential Election www chathamhouse org uk Source Ministry of Interior Publications and See appendix Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran s Presidential Election www chathamhouse org uk Where did Ahmadinejad s New Votes Come From According to the official Ministry of Interior voting data see Appendix Mahmud Ahmadinejad has increased the conservative vote by compared to the election There is little correlation in provincial level results between the increase in turnout and the swing to the President challenging the notion that a previously silent conservative majority has come out to support him Interestingly in out of provinces mainly former Mehdi Karrubi strongholds the official data suggests that Ahmadinejad received not only the votes of all former non voters and former Rafsanjani voters but also took up to of the vote from those who had previously voted Reformist According to the official data Mahmud Ahmadinejad has received approximately m more votes in this election than the combined conservative vote in the Presidential election Assuming that Ahmadinejad retained all m Conservative votes from these additional m votes could have come from three sources in descending order of likelihood The approximately m citizens who did not vote in but chose to vote in this election The m citizens who voted for the centrist Rafsanjani in The m citizens who voted for Reformist candidates in In order to examine in detail where Ahmadinejad s increased support came from the table below Fig shows the composition of the vote by province dividing it those who voted Conservative Rafsanjani and Reformist in and those who did not vote at all in It assumes that voters will vote again The table demonstrates that in the of Iran s provinces highlighted red in order for the official statistics to be correct Ahmadinejad would have needed to win over all new voters all former Rafsanjani voters and also up to of former reformist voters Serious complaints have been raised about both the elections and the elections Government data is not perfectly reliable In there were three Conservative candidates in the first round Ahmadinejad can reasonably be expected to have received in all votes cast for Conservatives in Here Ahmadinejad s performance is compared to the combined performance of all three Conservatives in Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran s Presidential Election www chathamhouse org uk It is notable that many of these are provinces where the Reformist cleric Mehdi Karrubi polled highly in and the government s figures would appear to suggest that his former supporters have not voted tactically for the likely Reformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi as many had expected but rather that they have defected to the hard line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad This interpretation is to some extent supported by the relationship between the percentage of former Karrubi voters in a province and its swing to Ahmadinejad Fig To many Reformists this situation is extremely unlikely Mehdi Karrubi is a well known reformist of polar opposite views to Ahmadinejad on issues of political and cultural freedoms economic management and foreign policy They allege fraud and it is likely that the provinces where Karrubi s vote has collapsed will provide the bulk of the complaints which the defeated c andidates are lodging against the conduct of the election However Karrubi like Ahmadinejad is seen as a man of the people and Ahmadinejad is as much a re incarnation of the Islamic Republic s early hard left as he is a leader of its current hard right Ahmadinejad s supporters thus claim that rural voters voted for Ahmadinejad in for precisely the same reasons that they voted for Karrubi in The data offers no arbitration in this dispute although Roukema s application of statistical fraud detection techniques to the by district data has turned up some anomalies with respect to the figures for Karrubi s vote which may suggest that they were created by a computer These can be followed up should the fully disaggregated by polling station data be released during the ongoing dispute B Roukena Benford s Law Anomalies in the Iranian Presidential Election as yet unpublished article Preliminary Analysis of

popular in rural areas and that this explains his high levels of support However the data from the Presidential election does not support this contention Instead it confirms that what support Ahmadinejad did gain in was mainly from urban and suburban areas The graphs below show the levels of support for Ahmadinejad against the rural population of the province in question Fig and Conservatives as a group Fig Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran s Presidential Election www chathamhouse org uk Source Ministry of Interior Publications and and Iranian Census of see appendix This data supports the con tention of academic experts on rural Iranian politics that rural voters have not been the dedicated Ahmadinejad supporters occasionally described in western media This is supported by the fact that much of Iran s rural population is comprised of ethnic minorities Lors Baluch Kurdish and Arab amongst others These ethnic minorities have a history both of voting Reformist and of voting for members of their own ethnic group For example they were an important segment of Khatami s vote in and and voted largely for Karrubi and Mostafa Moin in The data suggests a sudden shift in political support with precisely these rural provinces which had not previously supported Ahmadinejad or any other conservative Fig showing substantial swings to Ahmadinejad Fig At the same time the official data suggests that the vote for Mehdi Karrubi who was extremely popular in these rural ethnic minority areas in has collapsed entirely even in his home province of Lorestan

1490,Re: King Abdullah names Prince Hussein Crown Prince,Isn t a surprise since years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince Basically he s not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son with brother as option he has clear authority to do it I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he s not worried about an outcry from his fathers loyalists
1491,Re: King Abdullah names Prince Hussein Crown Prince,Well he s very young only Rumor is hes smart quiet bookish Like his father What is interesting is that the reason abdullah gave from removing his brother years ago is that he thought the weight of being crown prince restricted his life education and travel I suspect the reason he s done this is so his son can be properly groomed from now to inherit the thrown Life will change dramatically for him

Sid,http www quinnipiac edu x xml ReleaselD What strArea strTime hnt this page Close window Release Detail Obama s Approval Drops In Ohio Critical Swing State Quinnipiac University Poll Finds Senate Race Tips Slightly To Democrats Word format President Barack Obama gets a lackluster percent approval rating in Ohio considered by many to be the most important swing state in a presidential election according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today This is President Obama s lowest approval rating in any national or statewide Quinnipiac University poll since he was inaugurated and is down from percent in a survey By a small percen t margin voters disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy the independent Quinnipiac KWIN uh pe ack University poll finds This is down from a percent approval A total of percent of Ohio voters are somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the way things are going in the state while percent are very satisfied or somewhat satisfied numbers that haven t changed since Obama was elected In the race for Ohio s U S Senate seat being vacated by retiring Voinovich in Lee Fisher and Jennifer Brunner remain neck and neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOP candidates if the election were today The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America These numbers indicate that for the first time voters have decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems said Peter A Brown assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy blaming former President W Bush for their problems They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama possibly deciding that the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residency by such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with percent of the vote and captured the lion s share of independent votes Brown added Now by a percent margin Ohio independent voters give the President a failing grade on the economy These numbers indicate that he may be losing at least for now some of those who voted for him in and should be an indication to the White House that his honeymoon with the voters may be ending In the Senate race Lt Gov Lee Fisher holds a percent lead over Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner in the race for the Democratic nomination with percent undecided Former U S Rep Rob Portman holds a percent lead over car dealer Tom Ganley on the Republican side with percent undecided In general election trial heats Brunner would defeat Ganley percent and get percent to Portman s percent Fisher leads Ganley

Sid,Your request is being processed http www huffingtonpost com steve clemons can national security adv b html Steve Clemons Director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation Posted AM Can National Security Adviser Survive a Second Round of Attacks and Longer Knives I am here in London where I m participating in an interesting forum sponsored by the Princeton Project on National Security and the Royal United Services Institute RUSI Transatlantic Program I ve received not just one email but three from prominent insider journalists and policy hands that Jim tenure as National Security Adviser is highly fragile One of these emails reports starkly Knives getting longer That s all my contact said But other emails have intimated to me a serious tone deafness by about his role and responsibilities his relationship with the President and his relationship with younger dedicated hardworking and late working staff recently said that National Security Council staff members that stayed longer than pm must be disorganized in their work I speak to various NSC officials often at or pm at night They are hardworking racing as fast as they can to manage the many many many major initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneously pursue is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about management structures and decision making processes On the other hand his critics see him as a plodding slow moving out of touch retired general who was better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving His critics think that he s just too unable to animate nimble high flex policy decision making products for a White House on a manic dash to get a lot of top tier issues dealt with Friends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which NSC Deputy Tom is managing his brief Many see him picking up the load that seems unable or unwilling to carry is deeply engaged in the broad Middle East and Iran portfolio the non proliferation WMD arms control portfolio the China economic and security portfolio and he has according to reports supported and helped cultivate relationship building between State DoD the NSC and other parts of the national security bureaucracy Some tell me that decided to try and remove himself from the whack a mole crisis reaction style of decision making that could rob the Obama administration of the chance to define a new course in national security affairs Tom according to reports wields far more the hand of power when it comes to day to day management and responding to crises that require presidential attention and response in contrast has been obsessed with the structure of decisions who is involved in those decisions what the structure of decision making should be and what legal modifications to this process need to be made He looks at that as the big nut that needs to be cracked and that would improve according to Jim the President s effectiveness and chances of success at a macro level self determined task is not high profile mostly structural and has not won him many admirers for leadership but what he is doing is necessary If he departs his role this challenge of dealing with the growing complexity of national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making and decision making process will require the attention of someone serious So whether stays or goes his portfolio will remain vital But what is clear is that has enemies and that they are trying to undermine his place in the Obama orbit Their motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of management style but they very well could be his unwillingness to allow the liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to have more than their fair share of power in the Obama decision making process has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making quite evident when it comes to Middle East policy and the hawkish neocon friendly Likudist hugging part of the Obama administration s foreign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against I don t know if he ll survive this latest effort to oust him but folks need to know that those longer knives on the whole do not have pure motives Steve Clemons directs the foreign policy programs at the New America Foundation and publishes the popular political blog The Washington Note Shop Dell s full line of Laptops now starting at

1567,update: workshop key findings,Dear Secretary Clinton I hope that your elbow is healing quickly I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the region from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan Below are key findings from the report but the main takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technical analysis of China s capabilities would suggest and for a range of reasons technical and political prospects for regional cooperation are limited but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing All best Key findings from the workshop include Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than forecast years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within kilometers of the Chinese coastline The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of SSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols including India China and possibly Pakistan Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area have continued to develop with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka to complement the existing relations with Myanmar and Pakistan This may lead to a new form of blue brown water naval operations in which Chinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases but close to the coasts of client states The workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation easy These trends include Japanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within miles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan s maritime autonomy Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island Chinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile submarines operating close to India Indian interest in SSBNs plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan and even possibly Pakistani SSBNs all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean along with the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea Asymmetries in levels of operational competence and technology in submarines and maritime aviation which for example make functional multi national naval cooperation harder for states that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses The major role of land based maritime warfare strike complexes in this region which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in homeland areas The report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region The first scenario which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both compels us to consider The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate that their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected and What the United States would lose if it did not support the Japanese and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state capable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States The second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon potentially giving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close to territory of a client of China a blue brown water clash In this scenario China is using its navy to show presence and to force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less than black and white Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstances underscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by than a narrow assessment of their military capabilities would suggest On Fri at AM wrote Secretary Clinton The Australian is the newspaper in which I read your remarks on Asia Pacific Thank you again Sent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry
1568,Palau offended by US positions,Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of free association aid FYI only the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as well as the content and the overall approach They are even privately questioning the relationship This hasn t affected their intent to take the Uighurs I will send a few further thoughts At the conclusion of yesterday s meeting the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the United States delegation to the proposals that it made in in Washington D C and expanded upon in subsequent communications While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specific elements of the Palau proposal and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation The United States delegation did not seriously respond as required by the Compact to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palau s comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self sufficiency In light of the foregoing the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact Thank you Jeff L o

1597,Re: Thanks,Secretary Clinton Thank you Will update you when I hear from her and if there is anything else I should do let me know All best ps Saw that Foreign Minister Yeo was on your schedule today Fyi he is one of my favorite Singaporeans because of this speech on China which he posted to his blog Foreign Minister Yeo s speech at a dinner organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on which he gave off the cuff Thank you Kishore for your kind words Dear friends ladies and gentlemen I was in India two weeks ago had a good trip spent nine days there While in Calcutta after calling on the Chief Minister I had a bit of time to look around so I attended a mass at Mother Theresa s house Very interesting gathering there was a Singapore nun there she had been there for over ten years Sister Tony I wondered why someone from Singapore would want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of Calcutta and living that life There were many nuns there who were in their ninth year They take their first vow in the fifth year renewable every year In the tenth year they have to decide final vows for eternity So if you are not sure please there s a way out if you are sure then you re in the room So the priest gave a very tough sermon and while he was talking I could hear the din of traffic noise outside in the streets of Calcutta Then suddenly I heard the call of the muezzin Now this is a Hindu city I told myself I thought wow what diversity in this country India and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman from Albania should come their midst become one of them and then when she was beatified was celebrated as an Indian on the way to canonization China and India in that comparison China is not India China has a very different sense of itself its deep internal construction is very different Superficially there are similarities as there is between China and the US and China and Europe But if you look it s deep construction it is very different When we talk about China s future and China in the st century how China will behave in a world community China s attitudes towards democracy towards law towards social justice It is important first to look this deep construction because that is their nature Naturally we should not be deterministic there is nothing inevitable in human history but when we understand its nature it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and you ll be less suprised by its actions A few years ago the Chinese government embarked on a major project which is its dynastic duty to write the history of the Qing dynasty the Manchus from to Ever since the Han dynasty roughly contemporaneous with the Roman Empire they developed a historiographic tradition of each dynasty writing the history of the previous period So Sima Qian of the Later Han wrote of the earlier Han and the entire period before that then later on they wrote about the Later Han Jin wrote up the Three Kingdoms Ming wrote up the Yuan The Yuan which was Mongol in its origins wrote up the Sung Sung wrote up the Tang dynasty which was the Classical Period The last dynasty the Qing collapsed in the Republican Revolution of this is now I think in they embarked on this project The Official History of the Qing dynasty When the former Vice Premier Li Lanqing was in Singapore recently I asked him about it He said we told the scholars not to rush this project I asked him how long it would take to write this history He said it would take many years easily years I said have you collected the material He said yes I asked external sources He said yes external sources too All the countries the Vatican European countries the whole lot all assembled official histories this would be the th And Li s instruction to them was not to be too quick to draw conclusions Now Mao Tze Tung was a revolutionary he was a great revolutionary He overturned everything before but he knew his history he read the histories and not only did he read them he annotated them But he wrote with a terrible illegible scrawl so scholars had to decipher those scrawls Then they wrote commentaries on his commentaries and now it s all published It is very difficult for the Chinese to depart from their own history because it s the same great plains the same mountains more or less the same neighbours more or less and they have seen the same patterns recur So a long time ago during the Ming dynasty they wrote up the romantic period of the Three Kingdoms The first line said Below heaven great movements great currents long disunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity So they accept as a part of their own deep nature that there are cycles in their civilisation that they have ups and downs In recent years when you visit them you could sense them feeling their own re emergence it s a bit scary In the initial years they were lacking in confidence they asked many questions but now they know that there is an organic vitality It is like an adolescent who watches his own development and conscious of it I say scary because for those of us who live on the periphery of that empire what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually to a greater or lesser degree envelope us How do we see China I think to begin with it s important not to try and from an intellectual viewpoint transpose our own experiences on to China because I believe it will develop according to its own logic according to its own DNA It is growing now it will continue to grow it will develop its own contradictions and one day those contradictions many years from now will lead to its own decline So they say at the beginning of a dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full and at the end of a dynasty the taxes are crushing but the treasury is empty The important thing to realise about China is that some things are deeply resistant to change Take Confucius Every time they had to overturn a dynasty they had to overturn Confucius because Confucius justified the status quo So throughout the th century whether it was the Taiping Revolution the Communist movement or Sun Yat Sen they spent their lives debunking Confucius It reached its final moment when they criticised Zhou Enlai together with Confucius no Lin Biao together with Confucius That was the last paroxysm Today Hu Jingtao said in Mandarin He Xie She Hui harmonious society Suddenly you hear the resonance of Confucius coming back And everywhere in the world on the pattern of Alliance Francaise the Goethe Institute the USIA they establish Confucius Institutes and the learning of the Confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in China not yet in the state curriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the Confucianist ditties Now why is this important From Mao to Deng to Jiang Zemin at every stage they re interpreted Marx They are comfortable with the young Marx the idea of the superstructure on the economic base the idea that politics is concentrated economics that they like But the class struggle they downplay They talk about the Three Represents the progressive forces the progressive elements they nurture those Now Hu Jingtao says harmonious society peaceful re emergence This mindset has a certain attitude towards law has a certain attitude towards religion towards democracy and towards foreign policy and I would like to deal with each in turn Joseph Needham many years ago I think in the s the man who wrote The Science and Civilisation of China that great encyclopedic work he said its not that the Chinese have no legal tradition In fact by his estimation the Chinese had a greater corpus of legal codification than the West A greater corpus of legal codification than the West Surprise surprise But the idea that the Emperor is below the law that is completely alien to their thinking Where did that idea come from Well in the West you may trace it back to Hammurabi you may trace it back to Moses to Greece to Rome But if you trace the evolution of that DNA it goes back way back its early beginnings The Chinese had a very different evolutionary starting point It was not in law it was in an idea they call i which is proper conduct among human beings They believe deep in their instincts that law is only a means towards justice and that when the outcome of law is perverse then that law must be overridden because justice proper conduct the proper relationship among human beings must take precedence And to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties all that the earlier histories have summarised are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins in Western Europe which had as its crowning moment the crowning of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year to them what are you talking about For the Chinese laws are more like regulations means towards a larger end Their attitude towards democracy follows a parallel pattern Democracy is not an end in itself democracy is a means and they are quite happy to consider democracy as a useful means towards government and that at appropriate places and appropriate levels democracy is good So at the village and the township level they have democracy it is a universal franchise They approve a slate of candidates and they have fierce elections fierce campaigning and those who are incompetent or arrogant or despotic they get chucked out But once you reach the level of the cities and the provinces they say no No direct democracy Why not Because they do not believe with their view of the universe that that is the way to produce good government Any more than the Catholic Church believes that the way to elect the Pope is through universal franchise That the parishioners should decide who should be the parish priest The Parish Council maybe that s ok But the parish priest Bishops Universal franchise That s against God s laws They have that kind of instinct embedded in them it is not Communist it is just Chinese And they know that too much democracy invariably leads to localitis of favouritism towards friends relatives people who are from the same villages whom we have a relationship with We have the same problem in Singapore in fact this problem exists throughout East Asia Till today apart from Singapore among Chinese communities and among many East Asian communities the idea that ultimate control of the business should go outside the family is unpersuasive You talk to Li Ka shing you talk to Kwok you talk to Lim Soe Liong you talk to any of them they will go back to the family Why Because they believe that in the end what matters at the deepest level is trust And the family guarantees you that trust This is also the Indian wisdom So you have the Marwaris controlling the economy of Calcutta you have the Parsees you have Sindhis of which Kishore is a member you have the Chettiars They operate on the basis of deep trust and at a completely different level from that of contract law And because they distrust local affiliations in two dynasties Ming and Qing no senior official could serve within miles of where he was born No local official to serve within miles so in other words in Singapore no Singaporean can govern Singapore They go beyond that today there s almost no province in China where the provincial leader is from that province Now you consider this you transpose this onto Europe it s as if routinely the President of France is not French And if you are a German you are disqualified as a Chancellor of the Republic And an Italian cannot be trusted to serve in Rome Ancient wisdom What is remarkable is this is accepted as legitimate If you are Cantonese and you have a Northener squatting over you you do not consider it perverse or an abomination This is part of life and in fact you are more likely to have impartial governor than if a local boy were to be there because he is more likely to favour those who are related to him or those who are his friends So when you talk democracy to the Chinese it is against this cultural backdrop So what applied to the Qing dynasty the Ming dynasty they have taken a step further recently in China They introduced even more rules governing the circumstances under which you are disqualified from serving in the area near where you were born You can t stay in a ministry for too long you can t stay in a department for too long beacuse if you stay too long you develop affiliations and those affiliations will result in sidedoors and guanxi and corruption Of course many of these rules will still be breached and there will be scandals from time to time and they will act on those scandals For as long as the central leadership is pristine the system can be maintained But one day they will become corrupt as in so many previous dynasties and a downward spiral begins And it is very difficult in that situation to reverse it So I mentioned at the table that for India it s not a country that can sustain a revolution because its deep structure would not allow for it I think China is a country which can only be renewed through periodic revolutions Kishore asked me when I said well maybe in years time because these are long cycles and they expect as a matter of course that the history of the People s Republic would not be written by the People s Republic It will be written by the next dynasty Except that right now they say we shouldn t call it a dynasty we are now democrats we are a republic there is no Emperor Well whatever term you call it it will be done much later Let me now talk about their attitude towards religion Being a Roman Catholic I follow quite closely the ups and downs in their relationship with the Vatican and I find it quite fascinating The Jesuits when they went to China in the Ming dynasty hoped that they could convert the Emperor and all of China would become Catholic and a great mission would have been achieved They never succeeded Some of the brightest minds from Europe went there Matteo Ricci he corrected the Chinese calendar he repaired the clocks in the palace he saw the throne but he never got to meet the Emperor and he died in China And his tomb it s in the compound of the Beijing Party School today And the church which he founded is still there today Li Matou that s what he called himself he applied for permission to be buried in China and he was given that permission Then when the Manchus swept southwards in the missionaries thought now they had a chance the Manchus will be a bit more accomodating towards us we will yet Christianise China So if you read the despatches of the missionaries during that period the Tartar Wars they described it they were full of hope But not a chance They appealed to the Second Emperor Kangxi Can we send more missionaries No problem Can we have them all report to a papal legate in Beijing No such thing The Emperor imposed one condition you can send as many priests as you want to China but they must die in China they cannot leave after that You see instinctively the Chinese when they see the Catholic Church they see someone like themselves someone whose claim to its members is total And for whom that loyalty is a jealous one Mind you they do not try to control everything they just control the big things dogma doctrine After that you are left on your own and you are financially independent but on the big issue of who appoints ministers and provincial secretaries it s the same as the Pope appointing Bishops and Bishops ordaining Priests and governing this vast empire whether we re talking about the Chinese empire or the Catholic empire They have about the same number of members in the world which is why their interaction is a complex and difficult one And over the appointment of Bishops both seek ultimate authority In the end they have got to find a way to resolve it I can anticipate the Vatican s argument that we are not of this realm we are of the other realm so please we are not in conflict As for the Chinese leaders their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keep religion at arm s length Those who govern the empire they are areligious they can have private religions but in matters of their public conduct they are Confucianist In public you are not a Catholic you are not a Muslim you are not a Buddhist When the Jesuits went to China they were very impressed by this that it was possible to create a moral order based not on religion but on ethics So impressed that they wrote about it and influenced people like Voltaire and the other Encyclopedists It helped inspire the Frence revolution that you could get rid of the Church and still maintain a moral order in society I ve talked about China and law China and democracy China and religion now let me talk about China and foreign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest about which I can only talk about generally because you are the experts in this field I think it s very difficult for the Chinese to break from their old mindset that they are Zhong Guo the Middle Kingdom they are at the center of the Universe then there are the other chopsticks peoples who are semi Sinic I think they consider Singapore to be semi Sinic Then there are those who are beyond that realm who are what the Greeks would have called Barbarians The Mongols the Manchus the Europeans the Americans the Indians and so on Now all that jargon of course is not in use today They are very civilised they will welcome you with great hospitality lavish dinners very courteous words offering you the best of everything in the house It reminded me of the way my mother used to teach us at home we were a big family and the stranger has got to be treated well the visitor has to be treated well because you are afraid of the visitor So you always treat visitors better than your own family members because the visitor is capricious he can harm you so make sure you fit him in Those who are within your authority you can always maintain order anyway This is the way in their minds the universe is ordered So I can understand why the Koreans the Japanese the Vietnamese to some extent the Singaporeans they feel uncomfortable about what they see as a repetition of a pattern they have seen many times before in the past Will the Chinese change this principle of foreign policy I think they have because never in their history have they met have they existed in close contact with competing centers of power with the US with Europe India and you are no longer separated by oceans which cannot be crossed mountains which cannot be crossed now they are connected So they are making adjustments It will be interesting to watch how they handle their Olympics if the Olympics become an exercise of pure Chinese nationalism I think the international reaction against China will be very severe But I think the Chinese will be sophisticated I expect they will organise cheer teams for the Americans for the Japanese so that there is an appearance of courtesy and common humanity They are very careful to ensure that their words fit conditions today But let me say in their defence that many of these methods they use arise out of fear not out of a desire to dominate If you analyse the old tributary system those who sent tributes got more than they gave in return It became a racket So the Japanese merchants competed to get tokens from Ryukyu in order to be able to do the China trade because it meant a lot of money The Chinese are fearful of foreigners They are fearful of the Russians to the north the Muslims to the West the Indians across the Himalayas but mostly the Americans across the Pacific Their strategy is to keep the temperature low low profile hide the shine of your armour the shine of your sword just play the game and concentrate on economic development Internally will they make preparations I have no doubt because they have a deep fear Is their intention to dominate to conquer the way the European powers did in the past I don t think so I don t think there is a great desire to turn non Chinese Chinese Maybe Korea maybe Vietnam maybe Mongolia who at various points in time were part of their greater empire they might consider worth civilising But beyond that Sinicising Indians Russians No I don t think they will want to do that So as they now become stronger and more powerful I believe that while their old nature will re assert itself they will also be reacting to us If they find the world a threatening place they will develop their own responses to those threats Quite early in the day they wanted to neutralise Southeast Asia Asean It had never been an area which threatened them historically So they didn t worry about Southeast Asia as a threat But resources sea lanes they go through Southeast Asia And they made a dramatic move a few years ago Zhu Rongji was here for the ASEAN China summit He said free trade agreement At that time when he announced it the leaders of ASEAN almost fell off their chairs We thought of China an economic threat to us Not as a partner Took us almost a year to digest the implications and to say yes let s negotiate Step by step And all the time China was assuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit When the Framework Agreement was signed by Zhu Rongji in in Phonm Penh he made two remarkable statements He said if after years the agreement benefits China more than it benefits Southeast Asia let us renegotiate it I can never imagine the American USTR or the European Trade Commissioner talking like that I mean in a contract a deal is a deal it s settled for eternity Then he said China does not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia so he acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl we intended to be promiscuous from the beginning Towards Northeast Asia I think it is very complicated because there is so much history and legacy Towards Central Asia towards Russia they have deep fears Towards America it has become a relationship bound together at so many points a rupture would become more and more unthinkable But it is going to be a very difficult relationship it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in this century If it s badly managed there will be war if it s properly managed there will be another generation of peace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty In this area you are the experts but whenever I see China and watch its moves I go back to its deep nature because it s not easy for a country so vast with such a sense of itself to depart too much from its deep nature Thank you Yeo On Mon Apr at PM H HDR clintonemai com wrote Michele I look forward to getting together to discuss a number of issues Thanks for following up w Her email All the

1681,Melanne's event was wonderful. Get Shaun Woodward's memo? Miliband interview,below Sid http www guardian co uk politics jun david miliband gordon brown labour leadership print The Guardian Miliband Labour is facing the fight of its life Foreign secretary thought about quitting the government in last week s turmoil Miliband expressed his frustration at a lack of vision from the Labour leadership Photograph Martin Godwin Voters still don t know what Labour and Brown stand for Miliband admits today as he reveals how close he came to quitting the government during last week s turmoil at Westminster Speaking to the Guardian at the end of extraordinary days the foreign secretary says the party s high command was given an electric shock by the disastrous European election results and he urges fellow ministers to get out and prepare for the fight of our life But Miliband also concedes that he considered following his close friend and ally Purnell who resigned from the government last week and called for the prime minister to stand down Miliband said I d made my decision on Sometimes you can make your decisions with great planning and calculation and sometimes you have to make them rather more quickly made his decision in good faith I made my decision in good faith we all have tolive with our decisions The Labour party has a settled view of who should be leader he said This divides people who are close and people feel passionately one way and people feel passionately the other way Describing the task now facing Labour he says It could not be more urgent that there is a maximum of months until the next general election that we got of the vote nationally last week that we came second in Wales and that one in people voted for us If that does not electric shock us out of our ministerial chairs to think By God we have got the fight of our life on our hands because whatever the Tories are they certainly don t deserve a landslide then nothing will Miliband has not given a domestic policy interview for nearly nine months since he felt dogged by accusations that he was manoeuvring for the premiership He refuses to acknowledge that his decision to back Brown last week saved the prime minister saying it is impossible to tell But the foreign secretary feels his loyalty has given him the freedom to speak his mind without his motives being questioned by anyone in Downing Street Miliband betrays frustration at the absence of a clear Labour vision saying We need the message to go out that we have got the humility to learn about what has gone wrong It is not a masochism strategy It is about saying what we believe in It is about clarity priority adding up to purpose I know what we stand for I know what our instincts are but the voters don t Actually I know what Brown stands for We have a responsibility to make sure that come the election voters know what Labour stands for We were not being listened to people felt that they had been forgotten we neither inspired nor reassured He calls for cabinet colleagues to show stronger leadership in the battle to restore Labour s fortunes We need to make sure the talents and energies of not just the whole of the cabinet but the whole of the labour movement are give n free rein because one in people voted for us The truth is that we are not automatons We all have to get out there Asked whether he felt voters had stopped listening to Brown Miliband said He himself has said he has to build on his strengths and work on his weaknesses That is a good maxim for all of us He is someone who made the right decisions on the biggest issue of the day We have got a chance to fight with honour and dignity for what we believe in The stakes are very high because we know that parties can slump very dangerous positions Providing what he describes as a route map from the disaster he said Labour first needs a period of competent effective stable government secondly we need to reset our political compass so ministers are no longer locked in their departments but link their policies to their values and thirdly the government has to be at the cutting edge of policy On the issue of political reform he demands a speeding up of the pace of political reform saying it is not a piece of middle class frippery For the first time he reveals that he now backs the Alternative Vote for the Commons saying MPs legitimacy will be strengthened by being able to say in my constituency voted for me He says the change cannot be made before the general election He also backs a fresh push on Lords reform saying we have got an agreed blueprint He rounded on Tory spending plans but said Labour would clarify its own intentions before the election They will be credible and clear We will come to that in an open and honest way But he defends delay in setting out these figures arguing when you are in the middle of a Tornado it is a bad time take a forecast In an oblique reference to the Damian McBride briefings he also calls on the media to abandon unattributable briefings saying all politicians spokesmen should be named or not quoted by media outlets The gotcha culture of politics is not in anyone s interests he said Shop Dell s full line of Laptops now starting at

1693,#s,Most interesting observation of the day from State A statistical analysis of the data issued by the ministry of interior suggests a perfect linear relationship between votes received by Ahmadinejad and Mousavi with an r squared value of a near impossibility in nature This suggests that the ballots were never counted or were abandoned after it was clear Ahmadinejad was going to lose Statistically it is impossible to maintain such a perfect linear relationship consistently through all stages of vote counting We would expect variation as the votes were coming in due to differences expected between the cites and the country side and hetereogeneity amoung ethnic groups This to me is the most concrete evidence I have seen

1800,AAR,when you can I think I speak for the group when I say that we d like and After Action Report on last night s date with Dr Senkler especially curious if your plan to transition from the initial expanded group to a more restricted bilateral meeting worked as planned And while I m writing here is about the most straightforward piece about HRC ever written in the NY Times with this classic line a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit blowing out loud funny noises whenever she said something striking Clinton Ends Africa Tour Vowing to Stay Involved By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN The New York Times Published SANTA MARIA Cape Verde After a grueling seven nation day trip Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wrapped up her Africa tour on by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed Mrs Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde I have seen the joy and energy Africans have evidenced not just by the boogieing but by the hard work and perseverance she said referring to a recent comment from her husband former President Bill Clinton that she knew how to boogie with African dancers And we ve seen the worst humanity can do to itself she added presumably referring to Congo where Mrs Clinton met victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end Mrs Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission strengthening American relations with crucial allies on the continent like Nigeria and South Africa and sending a message of tough love as she called it to nations like Kenya and Congo Over all she said the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner not simply as a patron or dispenser of aid In exchange she said African leaders must deliver democracy and good government Mrs Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa even after she gets back to Washington closely monitoring the issues she addressed on her tour She also pointed to Cape Verde a set of palm studded islands best known for their beaches and enormous tourist hotels as an example of what good leadership can do This is possible she said You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility Kenya South Africa Angola Congo Nigeria Liberia And finally Cape Verde Mrs Clinton saw with her own eyes some of Africa s most promising countries and some of its most troubled ones In Kenya she pushed for the government to prosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year In South Africa the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the South African government should do more to help ease the crisis there In Angola the theme was good governing practices and oil a strategic concern of the United States given the many inroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources In Congo Mrs Clinton was passionate about the need to end the nation s rape epidemic The secretary s visit to the heart of the world s deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game changer for that conflict said Prendergast a founder of the Washington based Enough project Her commitment to addressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the usual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries Now he added comes the hard part making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations engendered by her visit In Nigeria Mrs Clinton pressed for electoral changes In Liberia she praised the country s president Johnson Sirleaf the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state The Liberian visit had a special warmth almost like a meeting of long lost cousins Liberia was founded in the th century by freed American slaves and the country s flag the people s names and even the police uniforms with plastic brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions Mrs Clinton received possibly her most exuberant welcome there and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit blowing out loud funny noises whenever she said something striking I love that the horn I want to take that guy with me wherever I go she said In Cape Verde Mrs Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick For once she said she had a cheat sheet on a country that included a list of far more positives than negatives The country has fewer than people and has escaped the turmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa The all inclusive poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in CanctIn or the Bahamas Mrs Clinton called Cape Verde a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa On just as she had at every stop she started her speech by saying I bring you greetings from President Obama She called him a son of Africa and said that under the Obama administration the United States was determined to help Africa reach its promise

1822,Speech/Middle East,HRC Back this morning from Asia Congratulations on the speech I think it came out great And the reaction I have heard today has been very positive Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as I understand it i e a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units There are two ways To describe it as an agreement explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a handful of units whose construction already has begun This raises some concerns It would represent U S legitimization of some however small Israeli activity in the West Bank and it would trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised sowing doubts about our effectiveness The alternative would be for the administration to say a We have come a very long way as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U S in terms of a settlements freeze This is a very welcome development b We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of housing units We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we have expressed to them c That said we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants an immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help promote a two state solution This latter option retains our credibility does not compromise our oft stated position and allows us to move forward Of course I am around if you want to discuss Good luck in India They are very excited about your visit

1826,Palau release on free association meeting,Below is Palau s statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review The fourth is the key paragraph I ll call Jeff o A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau islands which the U S took in war and subsequently administered for the United Nations The Compact which was signed in and took effect includes provisions of various duration Some are to last at least years including full U S military authority although the power of the U S to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to continue in perpetuity The amounts and types of U S budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for years but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its th th and th anniversaries The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands development The Compact also commits the U S to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau s long term economic development A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur Chief for Compact Review Koshiba Minister of Health Dr Stevenson J Kuartei Palau Community College President Dr Patrick Tellei Ambassador to the U S Hersey Kyota to the United Nations Beck and their consultants met in Honolulu on in connection with the th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office of Australia New Zealand and Pacific Islands Alcy Frelick the head of the US Delegation and representatives of the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services The U S delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further A number of the U S delegation s statements however evidenced a need for greater study by some U S officials of the intent as well as the letter of the Compact the relationship as a whole Palau s economic situation and fiscal responsibility commitments and Palau s contributions to the U S and to international harmony including sacrifice by Palauans in the U S military the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau s strategic location and posture and Palau s positions in the U N Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U S and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact deepen the relationship and develop its capacities as a freely associated state It appreciates the more positive expressions of U S Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political parties Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to positions befitting the great nation that is the United States Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U S and that the U S faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time Palau understands why more deliberation by U S officials can be needed Because of this because of the confidence that it has in the United States and because it would not be productive to elaborate with others on the conversations at this stage Palau s representatives are confining additional comment to official communications B

1862,Feedback,Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great But this time is noticeably different First people across the spectrum DC insiders reporters staff ex staff friends of friends WH folks etc were blown away Second people were REALLY moved by the last segment three people even told me they teared up I m guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days And I think because it s been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin with mixed messages and bad news coupled with many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the President and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you re in a class all your own including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident That you didn t wait for the envoy question was key you turned it a strength What you said about the President and how you said it one can t help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you ve adapted to the role You were definitely on your game You either threw a perfect game or at least a no hitter So this couldn t have gone better achieved everything we needed to times and comes on the heels of a great days Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this Because there was no substantive news it ll be a focus on style especially saving Biden

1878,Kenya,Secretary Clinton I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues I wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart Kenya has one of the strictest anti abortion laws in Africa it is illegal unless a woman s life is at risk and criminalizes both the woman and the provider Two years ago Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and two nurses falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions After a year in prison the providers were found innocent and released but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to make abortion less restrictive It will come as no surprise to you that as a result of their abortion law Kenya has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa with an estimated women a day seeking the procedure often through dangerous means Kenya is restarting a long stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution by next year Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which would codify that life begins at conception The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue If this fetal personhood amendment goes forward it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a provision It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African Union s Maputo Protocol one of the most progressive regional documents on women development and reproductive rights and with the vast majority of African countries in general For a country trying to regain the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently such a policy imposition would be a regression for women s rights and for the country writ large I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law I also visited several of our clinics and providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post abortion care You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world so I don t need to tell you how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost the bravery in standing up to constant government harassment and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe medical services I know it is asking a lot but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue when you are in Kenya you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are It is our hope that if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed Of course we would be happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there There is also a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of th and we are working on them to have a side meeting on this issue as well As always thank you so much for all you do We are all so grateful that you are there All best Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy Planned Parenthood Federation of America office

1927,"Peter Galbraith called, wants to talk to you...",Hillary Peter Galbraith just called me and I had a long talk with him As you know as chief of US mission to UN in Afghanistan he has protested the election fraud and come conflict with the head of UN there who wanted to cover it up Peter has just come out of Afghanistan after four solid months there He is pessimistic says the analogy to Vietnam is not wrong headed that comparisons of increasing troop levels there as though the surge in Iraq could be replicated are misguided but thinks there is an approach that should be attempted that involves the vote recount and trying to replace Karzai He wishes to speak with you directly He says that he has difficulty communicating with not because he can t reach him but because he finds Dick disjointed these days Peter is on a plane right now to Norway then London then to NY on Wed then could go to DC He says you can reach him through the US mission to the UN office FYI from Wash Post today The issue of how seriously to take the fraud charges and whether to force a runoff has also caused a rare public rift within the international community here The senior American official at the U N mission Peter W Galbraith left the country abruptly in a dispute with the mission director Norwegian Kai Eide Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorized to speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because it could undermine national stability Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number of polling stations in some areas in the south the incumbent s ethnic stronghold said one diplomatic source Eide and others the source said were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities could be smoothed over as they were in the presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin And I ve included below Jane Smiley s rave review of Max s book Sid http www huffingtonpost com jane smiley republican gomorrah b html Your request is being processed Jane Smiley Pulitzer Prize Winning Novelist and Essayist Posted PM HuffPost Book Review Republican Gomorrah About twenty years ago I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious his hand just rose up and the gun went off Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn t in fact his fault He never said I shot a man It just happened I thought of that man while reading Max s terrific but also of course appalling new book Republican Gomorrah Apparently there isn t a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican party who does anything Things happen God does it Satan does it No Republican is an agent of his or her own success or failure sin or redemption It just happens The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see screaming threats guns at rallies unhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn t feel the way he or she wants to feel absolute sense of powerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power Because that was the thing that struck me about the murderer in the he had the power and in his own last moments the clerk knew it But the killer no matter how well armed never felt it Republican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the various Republican operatives who surround Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing They invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely hurting destroying maiming and damning others who either don t accept their beliefs or don t acknowledge their power and righteousness Of course that is frightening But s cast of characters beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son Ryan and including Hagee Sarah Palin Ralph Reed Charles Colson Reisman Regnery Donald Wildmon et al strike the reader as above all else very small egocentric narrow minded uneducated selfish and resentful Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive Even those of us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about the power that they wish to exert does two things that no one else I have read manages to do the first of these is that he organizes the network He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected to Erik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connected to Tony Perkins is connected to Duke is connected to Mel Gibson and so forth and in the course of tracing these connections he informs us or reminds us of the crimes and misdemeanors these people have committed Two of my favorites are Dobson s son Ryan s messy divorce Dad seems to have paid the settlement did he not dare to discipline Or did he discipline too much and Vitter s habitual recourse to a brothel in New Orleans where Republicans wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings Republicans have impeccable taste in silk stockings the madam is talking about men Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes both those we ve already heard of such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard s and those we haven t there is good evidence that Texas billionaire T Cullen funder of the right wing Council For National Policy ordered hits on his estranged wife and succeeded in murdering his step daughter and the wife s boyfriend This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A Justified Sinner by Hogg in which once a man believes he is among the saved he can commit any sin he wants to and be sure he will go to heaven Once was saved for example he said My goal is to get to heaven I ll do anything it takes to get there and I m not going to let anything stand in my way He must have thought getting to heaven was just another power play And power plays are the key to right wing psychology Right wing psychology is the other thing that has to offer At the periphery of this world is your run of the mill bully a man like Jack Abramoff whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates but who sang like a bird once he was caught At the center of is Dobson a much more destructive figure than Abramoff who advocates in the strongest terms child beating and not only child beating but dog beating At one point he brags about going after the family canine who weighed twelve pounds and engaging in the most vicious fight ever staged between man and beast As for children the goal is to keep beating the child until he wants s to crumple on the breast of his parent In other words Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny and who over the years has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child rearing It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture cites Erich Fromm s Escape from Freedom about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism and Hoffer s The True Believer Insofar as he finds the documentation points out how many of these powerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children including Dobson It s a high number The beatings often arbitrary cruel and frequent were then in many cases backed up with constant lessons about God that he is arbitrary that he is cruel that he demands obedience above all things and that he surpasseth understanding The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child his shame and guilt as a worthless sinner and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in the hierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy goes pretty far with this psychology but in my view not far enough I m sure he was reared by liberal parents who gave him a sense of responsibility curiosity and autonomy and since he is only in his thirties I don t think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been interviewing and watching for the last few years I don t think he understands their fear how deep it is how constant it is and how arousing it is I don t think in fact that Max looks within and sees evil I think he looks within and says I m okay you re okay That s the goal of liberal parenting and as we can tell by statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy divorce and occurrence of STDs liberal parenting works atheists and agnostics for example have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals and states that have sex education in the schools rather than abstinence only education have lower rates of teen pregnancy But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all that the world makes no sense and so why try to make sense of it and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself or even to try to figure out what oneself might be is a death defying exercise There is safety only in two things conforming to a group and as a part of that group dominating and even destroying other groups The rules of the group can be anything at all as long as the members of the group abide by them And other groups have to abide by them too or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless The beaten child s sense of terror can only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power because in relation to his parents and to God he is defined as powerless When he crumples on the loving breast of his parent and in my view a person who administers a beating to a living being who is th his size doesn t know what love is he accepts his powerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life That s where your freedom and mine come in Many of the Evangelicals discusses are Christian Dominionists that is they differ from the Taliban only in their choice of doctrine Their uses of that doctrine to dehumanize women and other groups to never share power to control every aspect of every life within their power and to create society as a steeply hierarchical structure with them at the top are those of the Taliban It s an eye opener to read about R J Rushdoony son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide of You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace love and understanding but Rushdoony went the other way taking literally the laws in the Book of Leviticus In his book The Institutes of Biblical Law he advocates capital punishment for disobedient children unchaste women apostates blasphemers practitioners of witchcraft adulterers and homosexuals Gary North the Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist is his son in law and while not backing down on the mass death penalty advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake because stoning is cheaper and of course that is a factor because there would be a lot of people to exterminate As for who would be doing the killing of you and me if they could catch us well Christians would but not because they wanted to Ever unable to accept responsibility they assign agency to God who wants us killed who will beat us until we crumple on his loving breast a God who has given us all sorts of talents skills and interests but is like these Christian Dominionists interested only in power I believe his motto is Adore me or I will hurt you Can you believe in a God so small When I was a parent of young children I too got frustrated and I too thought a spanking might be a good thing I soon realized that my motives for administering physical punishment were highly suspect more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about effective methods I then saw a show about child rearing in which a woman who firmly believed in child between man and beast As for children the goal is to keep beating the child until he wants s to crumple on the breast of his parent In other words Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is

thing I soon realized that my motives for administering physical punishment were highly suspect more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about effective methods I then saw a show about child rearing in which a woman who firmly believed in child beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter and had much more family disruption than the parents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers Works with horses dogs and other animals too It was then I decided that if I in my human weakness could put two and two together concerning free will and proper behavior surely God could also I didn t want to believe in a God who was a smaller being than myself And I don t The ray of hope in s book is that the right wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologically unstable that they don t have much staying power think Ted Haggard But they have numbers The bad thing about that is that they could take control The defeat of Sarah Palin Conrad R MT Allen R VA Rick Santorum R PA Talent R MO and Mike DeWine R OH brought us back from the brink according to the website Theocracy Watch But only back from the brink The good thing is that they would not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long see W Bush The bad thing is that they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying If I take the long view well I think Stalinism lasted about years Nazism The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for years Russia and Germany survived Iran might as well But generations were lost in all these places And Stalin and Hitler didn t have nuclear weapons I think about the year old clerk in that convenience store looking down the barrel of that pistol He probably had no idea that his killer had no sense of agency hardly even knew what he was doing was seeing his hand as separate from himself But I have to feel sorry for the killer too subject to feelings that he could not label that were terrifying and overpowering I bet he was beaten shamed and neglected as a child I bet afterward he wished someone somehow had stopped him Don t forget to buy one Max Republican Gomorrah

1961,AFP/SL,From your clips US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark AFP AFP WASHINGTON AFP The United States responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka s Minister of Foreign Rohitha Bogollagama the State Department noted that the US government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed numerous cases of rape and sexual violence in Sri Lanka particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government However the letter signed by ambassador at large for global women s issues at the State Department said that in the most recent phase of the conflict from to we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context the letter said adding that Washington remains concerned about extrajudicial killings disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the protection of human rights the letter said Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the United Nations Security Council We ve seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere the US secretary of state had said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict according to published reports of Clinton s remarks Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka where government forces in crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after decades of fighting Colombo faced condemnation for its handling of the final stages of the war against Tiger rebels and managed to stave off a Security Council resolution calling for war crimes investigations thanks to the vetoes of China and Russia The United Nations has said that over civilians perished in the first four months of intense fighting this year Sri Lanka is now facing international pressure to free ethnic Tamil civilians who managed to escape the fighting but are now held in internment camps while they are screened to see whether they were rebels B

1986,H: Afghan. Sid,Hillary FYI I found this one of the most sensible and informed brief articles on Afghanistan Patrick Cockburn of the London Independent is one of the best informed on the ground journalists He was almost always correct on Iraq Sid Patrick Cockburn To say this war must be won in a year is nonsense http www independent co uk opinion commentators patrick cockbum to say this war must be won in a year is nonsense html SPONSORED LINKS Eight years ago I was standing on a hill miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky as the US air strikes started again st the Taliban front line There were a few ineffective puffs of fire from Taliban anti aircraft guns which could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down on them It was a strange war to cover not least because so little real fighting took place The reputation of the Afghan fighting man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment In the meantime they don t fight too hard for anybody and try to avoid getting killed The US and British press mostly reported the war of as a real military conflict and rather missed the point that the Taliban had just gone home I remember visiting the former headquarters of a Taliban armoured brigade in the city of Ghazni south west of Kabul The tanks and armoured vehicles had all been smashed to pieces by American bombs but when I asked local people how many men the Taliban had lost I was told none at all They could see what was going to happen so they just ran away Just as the US military victory of was overstated so eight years later is the sense of military crisis which is being busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan In Washington military officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in the next twelve months This is nonsense The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because they have Pakistani backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of President Hamid Karzai s government But the Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun community which makes up per cent of the Afghan population They will have great difficulty advancing areas occupied by the other per cent of the population where there is a Tajik Hazara or Uzbek majority Squads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul but there is no need to treat them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in The strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory but that they can inflict quite small military losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home They can do this through roadside bombs something the US army speaks as i f it were a new device though it was being used against the British army in Ireland in If the Americans and British try to hold territory supposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are vulnerable to being suddenly targeted by the other side It is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra soldiers But Afghans tell me that more foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more of the country becomes a battlefield It is absurd to imagine that the world s most heavily equipped military force is not going to use its weapons when it comes under attack Polls also show that Taliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been killed by American shells and bombs So what should Obama do First of all he has time He is not going to win or lose the war in the next year Like it or not he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea It is reasonable to suggest helping to produce a larger Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight Most military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear American flack jackets Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men often on heroin were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weeks training Many of them did not come back One way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid properly In Kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning a month which is not enough to live on unless supplemented with bribes This contrasts with a year paid to foreign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds Paying the Iraqi army properly really did make a difference in and might do the same in Afghanistan where per cent of men are unemployed A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were billion while the Afghan government is dependent on foreign aid The US and its allies will have to pay It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should be considering and not the panicky dispatch of US Forces or tens of thousand of more troops

2020,WaPo Outlook Piece,It s quite possibly the best thing written about you as SecState We re getting it around to friends family along with People op ed and NYT Mag q a was a great weekend in terms of positive press It s a m Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is By Rothkopf Washington Post When it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton we re missing the forest for the pantsuits Clinton is not the first celebrity to become the nation s top diplomat that honor goes to her most distant predecessor Jefferson who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped about men in America but she may be the biggest And during her first seven months in office the former first lady erstwhile presidential candidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods looks outtakes and of course relationship with her husband than for well her work revamping the nation s foreign policy Even venerable publications such as one to which I regularly contribute Foreign Policy have woven their all Hillary all the time coverage odd discussions of Clinton s handbag and scarf choices Daily Beast editor Tina Brown while depicting herself as a Clinton supporter has been scathing and small minded in discussing such things as Clinton s weight and hair while her defense of Hillary in her essay Obama s Other Wife was as sexist as the title suggests Indeed sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom as seen most recently in the posturing outrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now infamous question regarding her husband s views Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest whether the New York Times which covered Clinton s first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White House or The Washington Post where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer of choice for the secretary of state Amid all the distractions what is Clinton actually doing Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes in U S foreign policy in two decades a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and W Bush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post Cold War worldview The secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision a revitalized State Department one that approaches U S allies and rivals in ways that challenge long held traditions And despite the pessimists who invoked the team of rivals cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get along Hillary has defined a role for herself in the Obamaverse often bad cop to his good cop spine stiffener when it comes to tough adversaries and nurturer of new strategies Recognizing that the a m phone calls are going to the White House she is instead tackling the tough questions that since the end of the Cold War have kept America s leaders awake all night In these early days of the new administration it has been easy to focus on what Clinton has not achieved or on ways in which her power has been supposedly constrained Indeed some of her efforts have been frustrated by difficult personnel approvals or disputes with the White House about who should get what jobs But this is the way of all administrations More unusual has been the avidity with which the new president has seized the reins of foreign policy more assertively than either W Bush or Bill Clinton before him Obama s centrality amplifies the importance of his closest White House staffers while his penchant for appointing special envoys such as on Afghanistan and Pakistan and on the Middle East has been interpreted by some as limiting Clinton s role Given the challenges involved it was perhaps natural that the White House would have a bigger day to day hand in some of the nation s most urgent foreign policy issues But with Obama national security adviser Jim Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Gates absorbed by Iraq Afghanistan and other inherited problems of the recent past Clinton s State Department can take on a bigger role in tackling the problems of the future in particular how America will lead the world in the century ahead This approach is both necessary and canny It recognizes that U S policy must change to fulfill Obama s vision and that many high profile issues such as those of the Middle East have often swamped the careers and aspirations of secretaries of state past Which nations will be our key partners What do you do when many vital partners China for example and Russia are rivals as well How must America s alliances change as NATO is stretched to the limit How do we engage with rogue states and old enemies in ways that do not strengthen them and preserve our prerogative to challenge threats How do we move beyond the diplomacy of men in striped pants speaking only for governments and embrace potent nonstate players and once disenfranchised peoples In searching for answers Clinton is leaving behind old doctrines and labels She outlined her new thinking in a recent speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York where she revealed stark differences between the new administration s worldview and those of its predecessors The recurring themes include partnership and engagement and common interests Clearly Madeleine s indispensable nation has recognized the indispensability of collaborating with others Who those others are is the area in which change has been greatest and most rapid We will put Clinton said special emphasis on encouraging major and emerging global powers China India Russia and Brazil as well as Turkey Indonesia and South Africa to be full partners in tackling the global agenda This is the death knell for the G as the head table of the global community the administration has an effort underway to determine whether the successor to the G will be the G or perhaps some other grouping Though the move away from the G began in the waning days of the Bush era that administration viewed the world through a different lens a perception that evolved from a traditional great power view to a pre Galilean notion that everything revolved around the world s sole superpower Obama and Clinton have both made engaging with emerging powers a priority Obama visited Russia earlier this year and will host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his first state dinner in Clinton has made trips to China and India and she would have been with Obama in Russia had she not injured her elbow Both have visited Africa and the Middle East reaching out to women and the Islamic world On many critical agenda items from a rollback of nuclear weapons to the climate or trade talks such emerging powers will be essential to achieving U S goals As a result we ve seen a new American willingness to play down old differences whether with Russia on a missile shield or as Clinton showed on her China trip with Beijing on human rights At the center of Clinton s brain trust is Anne Marie the former dean of Princeton s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Now head of policy planning at the State Department elaborated on the ideas in Clinton s speech We envision getting not just a new group of states around a table but also building networks coalitions and partnerships of states and nonstate actors to tackle specific problems she told me To do that continued our diplomats are going to need to have skills that are closer to community organizing than traditional reporting and analysis New connecting technologies will be vital tools in this kind of diplomacy A new team has been brought in to make these changes real Clinton recruited Alec Ross one of the leaders of Obama s technology policy team to the seventh floor of the State Department as her senior adviser for innovation His mission is to harness new information tools to advance U S interests a task made easier as the Internet and mobile networks have played starring roles in recent incidents from Iran to the Uighur uprising in western China to Moldova Whether through a telecommunications program in Congo to protect women from violence or text messaging to raise money for Pakistani refugees in the Swat Valley technology has been deployed to reach new audiences Of course you need more than new ideas to revitalize the State Department you need resources too The secretary has brought in former Bill Clinton era budget chief Jack Lew to help her claw back money for statecraft that many in Foggy Bottom feel has been sucked off toward the Pentagon She has also created special positions to back new priorities such as as ambassador at large for women s issues Elizabeth Bagley to handle public private outreach worldwide and as the chief negotiator on climate Even just a few months in it s clear that these appointments are far from window dressing Lew and the acting head of the U S Agency for International Development are leading an effort to rethink foreign aid with the new Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review an initiative modeled on the Pentagon s strategic assessments and designed to review State s priorities has conducted high level discussions on climate change around the world notably with China Clinton made women s issues a centerpiece of her recent day trip to Africa where she stressed that the social political and economic marginalization of women across Africa has left a void in this continent that undermines progress and prosperity Clinton has also signaled the importance of private sector experience by naming former Goldman Sachs International vice chairman Hormats a respected veteran of four administrations to handle economic issues at the State Department as well as former chief executive of Discovery Communications to run public diplomacy In the same vein she has opened up Cuba to American telecommunications companies and reached out to India s private sector on energy cooperation showing that this administration will seek to advance national interests by tapping the self interests of the business community As with any new administration there have been inevitable problems The old campaign teams Clinton s and Obama s still eye each other warily but this feeling is gradually fading And by most accounts the administration s national security team has come together successfully with Clinton developing strong relationships with national security adviser and Defense Secretary Gates Her policy deputy Jim has renewed an old collaboration with deputy national security adviser Tom the two of them working with Obama campaign foreign policy advisers and Mark Lippert have formed what one State Department seventh floor dweller called a powerful quartet at the heart of real interagency policymaking Henry Kissinger may have overstated matters when he said this is the best White House State relationship in recent memory but it s not bad while the State Pentagon relationship is in its best shape in decades At the heart of things though is the relationship between Clinton and Obama For all the administration s talk of international partnerships that may be the most critical partnership of all So far according to multiple high level officials at State and the White House the two seem aligned in their views In addition they are gradually defining complementary roles Obama has assumed the role of principal spokesperson on foreign policy as international audiences welcome his new and improved American brand Clinton thus far has echoed his points but has also delivered tougher ones Whether on a missile shield against Iran or North Korean saber rattling the continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma or rape and corruption in Congo the secretary of state has spoken bluntly on the world stage even if it triggered snide comments from North Korea It is still early and a president s foreign policy legacy is often defined less by big principles than by how one reacts to the unexpected whether missiles in Cuba or terrorism in New York Promising ideas fail because of limited attention or reluctant bureaucracies and some rhetoric eventually rings hollow as the self congratulatory smart power already does to me Nevertheless there is evidence that seven months the job Obama s unlikely secretary of state is supporting and augmenting his agenda effectively Not as Obama s other wife not as Bill Clinton s wife not even as a celebrity or as a former presidential candidate but in a new role of her own making Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of Superclass The Power Elite and the World

2063,Col DCA letter,Attached and enclosed below is the demarche and letter that went out reflecting your comments SUBJECT DEMARCHE LETTER PRIOR TO AUGUST UNASUR SUMMIT REF A STATE B STATE SBU This is an action request see paras SBU On the USG and Colombian government provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement DCA septel We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota in about a month following a final review by both sides As noted in reftels the DCA would permit the United States access to several Colombian military bases and facilitate effective bilateral cooperation on security matters in Colombia It would not not authorize establishment of any U S bases or ports nor would it result in an overall increase in the number of U S military personnel or U S citizen civilian contractors in Colombia SBU On the Secretary and Colombian FM Jaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA including the importance of coordinating our public affairs and diplomatic strategies septel to follow There is some concern that the upcoming Union of South American Nations UNASUR summit would become a regional referendum on the DCA Colombian President Alvaro Uribe will attend the summit provided that a full range of regional security matters can be discussed not just the DCA In this context we are reaching out to selected UNASUR members to ask that they raise other regional security issues beyond the DCA SBU Action requested for Santiago Asuncion and Lima that you find an opportunity prior to the summit to raise the importance of discussing the full range of regional security topics during the summit and not merely the DCA with appropriate high levels of host government SBU Action requested for all that Ambassadors to UNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from the Secretary to host governments in advance of the summit U Begin text Dear Madam Mr Minister I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South American Nations UNASUR scheduled for in Bariloche UNASUR provides an important forum to address the issues and challenges that affect the region The United States supports the formation and effective functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR They promote stability cohesion and leadership on key issues and ensure the best possible communication between nations As you know our common neighbor Colombia has faced an ongoing threat from an unholy alliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidious illegal narcotics trade These terrorists have threatened the security of average Colombians and sought to overthrow by violence and corruption successive democratically elected Colombian governments The actions of these groups also threaten the security of other countries in the hemisphere sometimes directly in many ways indirectly Over the last decade Colombians have beat back this threat to the benefit of us all My country is proud of the role we have been able to play in this effort This battle is far from won Our governments and people are collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselves and our institutions from such threats I am certain these very issues will be addressed at the upcoming summit including the recently concluded Defense Cooperation Agreement DCA We understand the sensitivities associated with U S military activities in the hemisphere and the questions your government may have regarding the scope and extent of this agreement I hope the efforts made in the last few weeks by both my government and the Colombian government have helped address those questions I would like to take this opportunity to make several key points about the DCA First this agreement is a bilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen our cooperation on security challenges within Colombia permitting U S access to specified agreed Colombian fi facilities to undertake mutually agreed activities on Colombian territory It is a bilateral agreement that does not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of other nations On the contrary our mutual efforts to combat drug trafficking benefit the security of the region as a whole The agreement does not permit the establishment of U S bases in Colombia It will not result in an increase in the U S military presence in Colombia and we do not seek any such increase Activities undertaken at or from Colombian bases by U S persons will be coordinated in advance by Colombian authorities All activities will be based on full respect for the principles of sovereignty territorial integrity of states and non interventionism We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with nations in the region and we have endeavored to do so in recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms As concerns or questions arise I hope that you will feel free to reach out to us to seek clarification The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the organization to address a range of security issues that affect the hemisphere and I salute your leadership for deciding to discuss these matters The security challenges affecting our hemisphere and your nations in particular are pressing and grave Our firm belief is that a collective and collaborative approach to these matters is essential It is our commitment to work with UNASUR nations to help address these concerns Sincerely yours Hillary Rodham Clinton End text

2089,FW: MD oped,Apparently you can t get away from me We re sharing the FT op ed page tomorrow Here s my piece Thanks again for Much favorable comment Good luck at the UNGA President Barack Obama s announcement of a new system for protecting America s allies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he inherited from W Bush as a concession to the Russians In fact the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one and it is designed to counter an evolving Iranian threat not to mollify Russian anxieties Mr Bush s decision to put missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in the Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long range rockets that could hit the US The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter range Iranian missiles and it would have left much of Europe notably including America s ally Turkey unprotected Over the last several years the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few long range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter range ones that pose an immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East as well as to US forces stationed there Unlike Mr Bush s Mr Obama s plan will quickly field a missile defence capability to address an existing threat It can be upgraded to deal with longer range Iranian missiles in the future The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm should recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia Military experts there suspected that the US rockets in Poland while advertised as defensive could be used offensively even pre emptively against Russia Laying to rest that far fetched scenario was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama s decision nor should it have been However by removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations the president has improved the prospects for US Russian arms control negotiations now underway in Geneva Those talks could produce by a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic that is intercontinental weapons If ratified by the US Senate which will not be easy given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington the US and Russia will be on track for further reductions in the future Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev who are due to meet in New York this week have jointly called for the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons As they and their successors take steps in that direction they will have to grapple with a stark paradox of the nuclear age mutual deterrence depends on each side being vulnerable to retaliation from the other If either side has enough defences to trump the other side s offence the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be on hair trigger making war more likely in a crisis American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth the heads of their initially sceptical Soviet counterparts years ago The result was the Anti Ballistic Missile ABM treaty signed by Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in By limiting the defensive capability of both superpowers the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a series of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry Because nuclear weapons were expected to with us forever the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence Ronald Reagan was not The late US president championed the development of a space based comprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons and therefore mutual deterrence impotent and obsolete Many experts believed Reagan s vision which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars was an impossible dream So did his successor H W Bush who treated the program with benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks START begun by Mr Reagan The second president Bush reversed his father s policy He greatly weakened the START process pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national missile defence NMD system His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites in Poland and the Czech Republic was as one of his aides told me at the time in large measure about pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD Key officials of the Obama administration including the president himself who studied arms control in college understand the linkage between reduction of offences and regulation of defences However they have avoided raising that issue in the context of last week s decision That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own merits vis vis the Iranian threat But it is because they have more than enough fights with the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the principles of the ABM treaty Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating strategic defences Otherwise continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be either impossible or worse dangerous The

2149,Bibi/Abu Mazen,Seems the best for a bad situation Moves the public discussion from settlement freeze to final status Keeps some pressure on the parties And seems like you will play a more public role which is good You have more credibility on both sides than anyone Going forward if Bibi continues to be the obstacle you will need to fmd the ground from which you can make his politics uneasy I think you can do that even with current concerns in Israel about US posture But it will be easier as we rebuild trust so that our future admonitions are accepted An HRC trip there to reframe perceptions Finally need to be mindful of Abu Mazen s politics Taking a lot of criticism for meeting with Bibi without settlement freeze This is written from my BlackBerry

2154,How Anthony Weiner Helped the Public Option Return From the Brink -- New York Magazine,Magazine The Power Grid Back From the Death Panel How the public option helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House returned from the brink Published Oct On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health care bill by the Congressional Budget Office Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building merrily pissing all over the legislation instead It s just too weak he told me It doesn t do enough It doesn t achieve real cost savings There s no real competition It s pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies And those were merely Weiner s substantive criticisms of the bill His political assessment was even harsher It s effectively dead he said Not a droplet of Weiner s dismissal of the Baucus plan came as any sort of shock he s been trashing the Senate Finance Committee s efforts for weeks What s surprising is that anyone gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place Until six months ago after all the congressman was known more for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates In fact as Weiner would be the first to admit his interest in knowledge of and record on health care reform were perilously close to nonexistent And yet since when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean the realm of the just plain silly Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health care debate the clearest and savviest and as always loudest and noodgiest voice in favor of the public option And though it s plain that whatever bill eventually lands on Barack Obama s desk and yes I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health care paper will wind up there won t be anything close to Weiner s single payer dream his role in framing the terms of the discussion has been more than salutary In some non obvious ways you could argue that it s been essential I should confess at the outset that I have a long standing soft spot for Weiner whom I first met more than twenty years ago when he was a budding Chuck Schumer prot g and we played on the same Capitol softball team Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now amped up ambitious wicked smart forever gauging all the angles unafraid of being actually proud of being a royal pain in the tuchis All the qualities in other words that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a matter of opportunism in the best sense of the word This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn t have a mother ship that was directing the message and that created an entrepreneurial environment he says You didn t have the president out there speaking clearly about what he wanted And among my colleagues there weren t people that jumped out who either had a comfort with the material or weren t intimidated by the blowback Weiner laughs Frankly I like the blowback After my thirteenth town hall meeting someone on my staff said I can t tell if you re a sadist or a masochist Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum that he smartly stepped in to fill but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list the illness and death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and Foggy Bottom which deprived the debate of what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists For Weiner Clinton s absence and its implications carry a personal twist he is engaged to Hillary s longtime personal aide It s a weird irony that I m kind of part of the family now and this has become my issue Weiner says If Hillary had stayed in the Senate I would never have had this opening Weiner allows that he s discussed the health care battle with Clinton what she s told him he will not say But one imagines she approves of the cleverness and chutzpa he s displayed especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare an equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a government takeover of health care And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary s chagrin at watching the Obama White House pursue a dance of the seven veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in and Weiner s view of the administration s approach hasn t exactly been approving a point he s made abundantly and consistently clear over the past months On the eve of Obama s speech before a joint session of Congress Weiner cracked that up to now the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple of hours And he s apparently had no change of heart The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large he tells me Such criticisms haven t gone unnoticed at Pennsylvania Avenue in no small part because Weiner in a testament to his consistency lunacy inability to shut up or all three hasn t shied away from making them directly Indeed on a recent flight back to Washington from New York on Air Force One I m told by one congressman who witnessed the scene Weiner got a testy

2189,"Guardian front page tomorrow; also London Times, etc... See my other email.. Sid",Barack Obama snubs Brown over private talks White House spurned five requests from PM s aides for bilateral meeting Brown and Barack Obama at a joint news conference at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London in Photograph Jason Reed Reufers Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight after it emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G summit starting in Pittsburgh today The prime minister eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early either due to ill health or deteriorating eyesight There have been tensions between the White House and No for weeks over Brown s handling of the Scottish government s decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing Abdelbaset al Megrahi Brown s efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi delivered a minute speech to the UN massively running over Brown s minute slot Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint press conference an event that would have boosted Brown s efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of international diplomacy Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week in an attempt to rebuild relations No denied there had been any hint of a snub saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they sat next to one another at the summits They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future economic regulation bankers bonuses nuclear non proliferation and climate change Brown himself insisted I do say that the special relationship is strong it continues to strengthen But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president Hu Jintao the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and the new Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a parliamentary aide resign over the prime minister s refusal to sack Lady Scotland the attorney general after she was fined for employing an illegal immigrant as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary Charles Clarke Stephen Hesford Labour MP for Wirral West told Brown in a resignation letter In my view the facts of the case do not matter It is the principle which counts particularly at a time when the public s trust of Whitehall is uncertain to say the least We have to be seen to be accountable Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown s leadership risked letting the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of the expected date of the general election and sink for a very long time He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true I think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution In two interviews Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health My sight is not at all deteriorating he told NBC Asked on BBC Radio Live whether he might quit for health reasons the prime minister replied I am healthy and I am very fit I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit I keep going I have got a job to do I have got work to do We have got to meet this challenge In his own speech to the UN Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush administration an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem In remarks that suggest Obama will focus on broadening American alliances across the globe he said The time has come for the world to move in a new direction a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect Last week the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds something No had not highlighted Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live and then received a hero s welcome as he returned to Tripoli Brown had said he respected the release but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low key had been broken In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel Gaddafi after Libya s leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address Gaddafi said the security council should be renamed the terror council Brown countered in his speech in New York later I am here to reaffirm the UN charter not to tear it up I call on everyone to support its universal principles He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism that were as huge as the banking crisis On climate change he said If we miss this opportunity to protect our planet we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future There will be no retrospective global agreement to undo the damage we have caused This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we are inflicting on future generations He added If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt if the emerging economies are going to embark on low carbon development paths if the forest nations are going to slow and stop deforestation then the richer countries must contribute financially No again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night A spokesman said the stories were without foundation As we have said throughout the week the prime minister and President Obama are having a number of meetings throughout the week These included a wide ranging discussion following last night s climate change dinner They will also be co chairing an important meeting on on Pakistan and the fight against terrorism As the prime minister has already said there will be further meetings at the G summit in Pittsburgh

Sid,Barack Obama rebuffs Brown as special relationship sinks to new low Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama during his trip to the United States as the fall out from the release of the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left the special relationship at its lowest ebb for nearly years By Porter Political Editor in New York Published PM BST Sep British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders said diplomatic sources But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing on his own with Mr Obama had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York kitchen The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point since Major s frosty dealings with Bill Clinton It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama despite the President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan China and Russia Downing Street claimed that this was not unusual However a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House s refusal to meet Mr Brown had been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone the source said There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off The most striking example of Downing Street s desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa It aimed to match America s commitment and was announced last week As a result it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference according to a senior source However the meeting never happened The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan and would spend all day together However s meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G group of world leaders The release Oof the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi appears to have been behind the new chill in relations between Washington and London Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month Downing Street s original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President s anger Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive Nearly Americans died when Pan Am flight was blown up over Scotland in Yesterday families of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya s leader Col Muammar Gaddafi made speeches Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on night The minute walk and chat took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in Manhattan No maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate bilateral meeting with the President There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting with Mr Obama In a speech to the United Nations Mr Obama said the world must move in a new direction and embrace a new era of engagement That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances Mr Brown s increasingly poor relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony who enjoyed close friendships with both Mr Clinton and W Bush Major s Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton however because of claims that Mr Major had tried to help Bush Snr s re election campaign in by allowing researchers to dig Mr Clinton s student past at Oxford something Sir has always denied Mr Brown whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for minutes faced attacks on several fronts yesterday Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing travelled to New York to protest outside the UN headquarters They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of justice for victims families The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme Shirin Ebadi Iran s only Nobel Peace Prize winner said the West cared more about its own securit y than human rights Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year Guests paid to attend the function attended by among others Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono

at women in the DRCI can scarcely be adequately described Some rapes are being reported each month with an average of women and girls raped every day Triple checking the origins Hillary Clinton Pledges to Banish Sexual Violence Originally posted PM EDT Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well earned R R in Bermuda this week but last week the former First Lady and U S Senator wrapped up a grueling seven nation diplomatic mission to Africa While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton s thoughts on a trade issue My husband is not the secretary of state I am she retorted the emotional heart of her tour was also her most dangerous stop in Goma inside the war zone in eastern Congo where she tearfully met rape victims on Aug In this exclusive Op Ed piece for PEOPLE com Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit and what she will do about it What I Saw in Goma By Hillary Rodham Clinton In days of travel across Africa I saw humanity at its worst and at its best In Goma last week I saw both The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma a provincial capital in the eastern Congo The camp is now home to people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent conflict that has left million dead since Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal militias these men women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe haven Now they live in tents one next to the other row after row some clinging to life others hanging on to whatever glimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality Many of these people have been robbed of their homes possessions families and worst of all their dignity Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale as sexual and gender based violence has become a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions Some rapes are reported each month with an average of women and girls raped every day I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months pregnant when she was attacked She was at home when a group of men broke in They took her husband and two of their children and shot them in the front yard before returning the house to shoot her other two children Then they beat and gang raped her and left her for dead But she wasn t dead She fought for life and her neighbors managed to get her to the hospital kilometers away I came to Goma to send a clear message The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and abet them They are crimes against humanity These acts don t just harm a single individual or a single family or village or group They shred the fabric that weaves us together as human beings Such atrocities have no place in any society This truly is humanity at its worst But there is reason to hope We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge And we have seen health care workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded in Goma I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have been raped often by gangs and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children or walk or work Caregivers like Lyn Lusi who founded Heal Africa in Goma and Dr Mukwege who founded the Panzi hospital in Bukavu represent humanity at its best The United States will stand with these brave people This week I announced more than million in new funding to prevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo We will provide medical care counseling economic assistance and legal support We will dedicate nearly million to recruit and train police officers to protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence We will send technology experts to help women and front line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options And we will deploy a team of civilian experts medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist survivors of sexual violence While I was in the DRC I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila I stressed that the perpetrators of these crimes no matter who they are must be prosecuted and punished This is particularly important when they are in positions of authority including members of the Congolese military who have been allowed to commit these crimes with impunity Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma and it will not end with my departure We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence the fighting that goes on and on in the eastern Congo We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an end to this conflict There is an old Congolese proverb that says No matter how long the night the day is sure to come The day must come when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again to tend their fields play with their children and collect firewood and water without fear They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources They are strong and resilient They could if given the opportunity drive economic and social progress that would make their country both peaceful and prosperous Working together we will banish sexual violence the dark past where it belongs and help the Congolese people seize the opportunities of a new day

2233,Branch Summary,See below Will send PIR comments shortly To CDM Fr Caitlin Re Branch Book Overview There are few surprises in this book The surprises that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up on the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC s crime bill and why he hadn t disclosed information about Lewinsky because he hadn t wanted to become a witness against her There are a lot of things that have been covered in My Life and other publications Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated While not as and this day and the next day as My Life it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one Furthermore WJC s words are so interlaced with Branch s recollection through his dictations that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch when he is recording WJC Her statements were consistent with the past with the exception of the Gephardt comment and didn t grab much attention at all Ell Others included HRC s devotion to CVC thought that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with Branch Surprisingly or not surprisingly many of the problems discussed in the book are those which face the current Administration Middle East peace North Korea China etc Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the Administration and events of the time He clearly has topics he prefers over others for example his connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda Its absence from long discussions was surprising but it did not appear as thought WJC ever dodged questions about the topic they just weren t addressed Much like My Life one theme that repeated itself was WJC s conflict with and disdain for the media especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting but you would be hard pressed to find them Additionally there are numerous mentions of WJC s acute allergies and his chronic fatigue with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions The book has quite a bit on Whitewater but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could write that hadn t been said One thing I had not recalled was the D Amato s subpoena of CVC s friends later quashed who slept over while HRC s Rose Law Firm records were in the White House Branch does portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater because this was a legitimate inquiry There are some quips that could catch someone s eye such as WJC referring to Paula as a new bimbo he WJC didn t even recognize Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment With the exception of Bruce Bennett and Kendall no other lawyers are mentioned There is one passage that I am looking in which WJC says part of the reason he didn t mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her This is a very small passage that could easily be missed but one that it is important to note as I don t recall hearing this before This is addressed more fully below There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others They include WJC s relationship with Gore which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan All three of these issues are discussed in turn below WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light than other books articles covering this time period with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC both pre and post impeachment On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East Northern Ireland the Balkans China Russia Pakistan India and in the beginning of the book Haiti Note Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branch s own experience there and on the subject There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life which seems to have more detail and background than this book In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS cancelled one stop because they would be defenseless flying in whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined with assassins There are candid looks at WJC s take on certain people and the relationship between some such as and s dislike of and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin s drinking such as yelling outside of House for a cab to get pizza One thing to note is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless Such is the case with HRC s Gephardt comment The following items are addressed in the memo Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill WJC and Lewinsky s Silence HRC and Kissinger HRC and gay lesbian Tension with Moynihan HRC as World Player Jesse Jackson Tension with Janet Reno Portrayal of Carter Relationship with Gore Other This includes Maggie recommending Panetta HRC and Haiti Invasion ITAV co author flap Subpoenas of CVC s Friends Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex Gore HRC ticket WJC suggesting Rubin run for Senate Trip to South Asia Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill In discussing Wen Ho Lee s release Branch characterizes WJC s lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of the anti terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a confession My Life only mentions Lee s accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee Below are two passages from Branch s book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill The year closed on spies and terrorism The Justice Department after fierce debate among the security agencies indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant no bail lockdown solitary confinement even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day This sounded fishy to me Clinton shrugged Nothing would please him more than to establish Lee s innocence Branch While Lee was indicted Branch writes that WJC noted that others were being held in secret uncharged and untried He WJC was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure law without foreseeing such arbitrary detentions Under the terrorist act any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise To his dismay Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months One extreme detention had last three years I think it s wrong he WJC said It s not American We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom Branch WJC and Lewinsky s Silence Branch writes that part of WJC s motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her to jail as she had denied it Also he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship he said Starr could have turned him a witness against Lewinsky betraying her discreet silence Such subtleties while original struck me as tendentious The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky s account Branch HRC and Kissinger The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor Roosevelt There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn t be able to see his own doctor She continued to say it was interesting in fact that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying Oh no Dr Kissinger she replied coolly Don t be sure that it s dead We ll keep fighting and there s always light at the end of the tunnel She said Kissing blanched speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War Now at last in Hillary s dream it registered that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years That s what I dreamed Hillary repeated lost in thought You know I always get my revenge in dreams but never in real life Branch HRC and gay lesbian Writing about a call with HRC from NYS Branch recalls how WJC s counsel got very exercised WJC left the room He was subdued on his return You know I ve had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary He sighed Her temperament had a conservative religious core formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable New York politics was a tough crucible and she was unsure what heat she could take On the other hand personal experience could speed adaptation Branch Tension with Moynihan There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC s grievances and frustration with Moynihan For example When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for themselves Branch writes The president flinched when I mentioned it That s just a freebie for him snapped Clinton and he knows it p In regard to health care Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner he WJC faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme p Discussing Independent Counsel She HRC was especially scornful of the Democrats and quoted a number of them Senator Moynihan for instance publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to hide Why not have an investigation he often asked She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface never produced results in Congress and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation Brach Donnybrook argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical about a controversial decision Moynihan told the press He doesn t understand that he s conceding the principles WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clinton s motives Branch HRC as World Player There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage both with WJC and on her own Several examples follow Middle East Discussing peace with King Hussein They had retreated for lunch as two couples the Clintons with the king and his wife Queen Noor in the family dining room Their agenda was a delicate race between Hussein s failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement closed boarders water disputes travel barriers war grievances contested airspace sealed electrical grids and so on Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point Branch South Asia Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in Her HRC s schedule was far more demanding than ceremonial pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women Branch Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC By contrast with a superficial American press which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small scale economic development The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying she HRC played the traditional role of First Lady as wife and mother Branch China Speech Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the harsh reality everywhere from China to Africa He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC s speech Branch Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown Branch writes Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly Branch Jesse Jackson Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her throughout the period WJC thanks him for his support of CVC This goes some detail about WJCs gratitude but the fact that Jackson counseled CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least But now Jesse had done something he would not forget When the Lewinsky news broke he called Chelsea at Stanford Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number How he got it was another story Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics He did not know everything involved but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her Their family needed to stick together now above all and if she needed to counsel rage or pray he was always available Branch Tension with Janet Reno Throughout the book from his nomination of her WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of Janet Reno He complained about Janet Reno made it clear in fact that he felt alienated from his own attorney general If he removed her however the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor for campaign finance would fall to Reno s deputy Jamie Gorelick who Clinton feared may share Reno s wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a target If he removed both Reno and Gorelick to start fresh it would touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixon s Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal That was not an option Branch Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D Amato and continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros The same held true for Mike Espy Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno Reno had made public statements about her desire to stay on the job I told her I didn t like that one damn bit the president said tersely I didn t hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post I hired her to work for me Branch He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including coordination with U S attorneys and that he didn t blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater but that he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since letting mandates multiply almost at will She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan Reno had failed to defend the presidency itself not Clinton personally but the institution and by extension the entire executive branch He told me she had no clue what he meant His advisers considered her more na ve than upright and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her Branch He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term Portrayal of Jimmy Carter There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC BHO and Carter WJC both in terms of Carter s trip to North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter s seeming desire to be on the front lines North Korea On North Korea he WJC said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea s extreme isolation Sure enough Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il sung who proposed to allow inspection of North Korea s nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place News stories had the White House seething but Clinton made light of the spat He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy if the game were still in doubt Branch Haiti After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore who said Carter shouldn t be trusted a second time and and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the junta Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having clientitis arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States best interest He didn t want to leave and WJC told him he had to Like after North Korea Carter again Carter went to the press first The three negotiators flew back to Washington late and Carter invited to stay over at the White House called CNN s Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission This conduct the president said tersely was not right The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference he allowed exhibiting a keen political ear To Clinton Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman even about a mission he had accepted for the United States government complete with an Air Force jet This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn but Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance He considered Carter a sterling ex resident Branch Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent including former presidents Ford Reagan and Bush Dole will support me he said Carter will probably criticize me Carter always criticizes but he doesn t have much positive to say Branch Gore For the majority of the book there is little discussion of WJC and Gore s relationship There are few places where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity The end however describes the seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the election and the impeachment On page Branch writes No he Clinton did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy as alleged but to improve public presentations by his troika of bad talkers shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake boring Secretary of State Warren and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin Branch In one passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O Leary and also having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that Gore not WJC attended Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his absence Gore pointed to a few days in but WJC pronounced them vital to Chelsea s schoolwork Gore blinked So what Mutual exasperation spiked Al Clinton told him I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams Gore erupted He thought Clinton had lost his bearing They had a big fight said the president and were still wrangling about dates for Japan Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw Lewinsky Branch On page there is a scene which shows Gore s sense of humor and Gore WJC et al working as a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal lawyer HRC already knew he was paying the first one per month The conversation is about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore On Gore s announcing his campaign The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff events once from Geneva hours later from Paris Clinton thought the only glitches were technical But Gore got all the big things right His twofold message was perfect distinguish himself from Clinton s personal flaws and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton s affair with Lewinsky inexcusable First it was true Second it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss Third Gore would be badgered to death until he did Al Clinton told him if you thought it would help in the campaign I would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post Branch Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign On tape the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore s pollster Mark Penn The vice president must project his platform where he stood precisely how and where he would lead the country because the Republicans would try to knock him off substance Branch WJC offered critiques of Gore s campaign throughout but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding him For example Clinton still thought Gore could win Most people considered him smart experience and motivated He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the country Reporters called Gore stiff but Clinton discounted this liability He thought Gore s droll sense of humor would wear well over time Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat therefore lacking independence which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives Then the president said Gore could have a brooding quality about him not worrisome or off putting in itself but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to give voters a lifted Clinton isolated the word sunny Gore needed more of it Branch He also complimented Gore s knowledge of government workings Gore knew Washington Believe me said the president his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice president He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey although he also goes great detail about the virtues of even though she would never get chosen How much of this was WJC s emphasis versus Branch s focus on his home state senator is unclear Branch WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration They should be running essentially for a third term said the president but they were afraid the Clinton Gore record would tarnish them with Clinton s character Branch Branch gives WJC s critique of Gore in debate that had been heard before that Gore lacked style and a light touch Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where Gore had bared himself in one of their stressful consultations by insisting that he Gore was a good politician elaborating that he meant good on the policy and also good on the politics but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two Gore said he had to think about it and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone He had the stuff to be a great president and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record Branch The big passage about Gore begins on page and extends to Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first about recording the details At the outset it says For his own part Gore was not angry nor did he blame Clinton for his defeat but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did Branch It has WJC acknowledging that Gore s use of him was proper he was best in the White House Then he says I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days Clinton told Gore but otherwise that was not a big deal I was much more upset about your message now that we re being honest Branch Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that Clinton s drag plagued every direction Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than Clinton and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush and that he was an unparalleled vice president but that he had blind spots Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was surreal o Gore had a fresh grievance he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund raising scandal had been the worst experience of his life No one had ever questioned his personal integrity but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton However he remembered telling the president that he found himself the only English speaking person at one of those Asian fund raisers And the president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble So he did blame Clinton in a way The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion Gore must still be in shock from the election or unhinged I thought he was in Neverland he said Branch o Branch continues The vice president asked Clinton about Lewinsky He had supported Clinton all through the impeachment publicly and privately while declaring himself disappointed Yes said the president He appreciated that However persisted Gore Clinton did not confide any personal feelings He never explained exactly what happened There was little to say Clinton replied beyond failure and regret He was humiliated and angry had made mistake He had misled the American people and he was sorry Gore closed his point with emphasis Well he said this is the first time you have apologized to me personally Clinton did a double take Gore treated the confession as a watershed Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry Clinton exploded that Gore s reaction was phony What was so significant here Gore exploded back He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that somehow cost the election Clinton s character was at the root of it Branch Other Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta Unlike in My Life in Branch s book it has WJC asking Maggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty s replacement Williams was shrewd discreet and efficient Branch HRC and Haiti Invasion Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team s suggestion to invade Haiti He said the pell mell rush to invade was crazy to her Reacting against the pressure the lack of options and his sense of being trapped she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion Lake and were the same people who had pushed the ill fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary Branch ITAV ITAV co author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book s collaborator Barbara Feinman a friend of Quinn HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRC s handwriting Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks were discovered in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House Branch Subpoenas of CVC s Friends Branch tells of how D Amato as Chair of the Banking Committee had subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC s Rose firm records were there This included some two dozen of Chelsea s sleepovers Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers Branch Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex In the context of Lewinsky Branch says of Vernon Jordan In our glancing associations I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or recreational Branch Gore HRC ticket By the numbers and Clinton s gut a Gore Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance to defeat Bush for the White House Hands down he WJC said tut I don t think Al would ever do it Branch WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting HRC if she decided to run which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected When the president had urged him Rubin to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat Rubin recoiled He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now Branch On trip to South Asia Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh because of hard intelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins Branch My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins DI Gephardt is an asshole Hillary commented The president pointing to my recorders advised gently that the tapes were on She winced but shrugged with a smile Well he is she insisted In an awkward silence I backed up both machines to erase the first lady s epithet Branch

2237,Devin and I wandered a corner of the health care debate on Saturday in the Post....,Counseling That Helps the Dying Live By Devin and Many opponents of health care reform have concentrated their fire on a provision in House legislation that would provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end of life counseling How our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial Unfortunately the debate has degenerated a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion including invocations of Hitler and fear mongering about death panels As a result of these attacks a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress have abandoned support for end of life counseling Our family s experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and the misguidedness of the campaign against it Brooke Shearer wife mother and grandmother had been fighting cancer for more than a year She had undergone major surgery numerous scans and biopsies and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy Her doctors were among the best in their fields Their expertise did not however extend to the fine points of and latest advances in pain management Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her family for whatever time we had together With that goal in mind she sought advice and treatment from palliative care specialists at Washington Home and Community Hospices Their ingenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in her final months Working closely with her primary physicians the hospice staff helped Brooke anticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and exercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our family s adjustment to it When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working Brooke put herself fully the hands of Washington Home as an outpatient Regular house calls by hospice doctors nurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects spend time with friends and family and end her life at home which was a considerable comfort to her and to us These not issues of cost were the principal considerations for our family However controlling the cost of health care especially in the last year of life is an important part of the current national debate Therefore it is worth noting that Brooke s treatment in the last stages of her illness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year It has often been said that dying can be a full time job That was emphatically not the case with Brooke Until her final days she concentrated on living a choice that end of life counseling helped make possible Hospice care more than meets the standard of the Hippocratic oath It not only does no harm it does good it is not about hastening death but enhancing life If counseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform many Americans will be as well Devin along with his brother Adrian is co founder of GenerationEngage is president of the Brookings Institution President The Brookings Institution Massachusetts Avenue NW Washington DC

2275,Time,I ve attached the gorgeous cover as a PDF Hillary s Moment Clinton Faces the World By Joe Klein Time Magazine Nov It was Halloween night in Jerusalem and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker We re prepared to start peace talks immediately the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed with U S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton standing at his side poker faced I think we should get on it and get with it It was a ploy of course The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves yet again They had elections looming and their leader Mahmoud Abbas had to hang tough he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement building on the West Bank which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored Netanyahu was offering a partial freeze not including new settlements in East Jerusalem the desired capital of a future Palestinian state This was a nonstarter for the Palestinians but it had the holographic glow of a step forward It was an unprecedented offer Netanyahu trumpeted with the joy of a chess master springing a trap See photos from years of Israel It was a tough moment for Clinton playing second fiddle at the Bibi does Gandhi show President Barack Obama had softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier instead of a total freeze he had talked about Israeli restraint in settlement building And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration s retreat agreeing that Netanyahu s proposal was indeed unprecedented even though the U S still favored a total freeze The most important thing she added was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible The onus was back on the Palestinians and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration s retreat Their Arab neighbors soon joined in causing Clinton to backtrack two days later telling reporters the Israeli plan falls far short of U S expectations although she still insisted on calling it unprecedented which was neither diplomatic nor wise Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East clearly Clinton had been too bullish on Netanyahu s proposal which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy and was seen privately by the Americans as real progress But the Administration s mission was to get the parties peace talks without preconditions The Israelis were now in favor of talks The Palestinians were setting preconditions And Clinton had violated an essential rule of her job boring is almost always better See photos from the life and career of former Secretary of State Madeleine Clinton s Three Qualities For the past years the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State You go to Jerusalem or Ramallah you stand there guardedly optimistic in public in private you try to move a comma but the Israelis or Palestinians move a semicolon to block your comma The result is almost always the same gridlock The breakthroughs when they come emanate from others Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he d be willing to go to Jerusalem and Sadat to everyone s surprise says yes The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and reach what appears to be a breakthrough they re talking which then becomes another dead end The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous in some ways the Department of State a noble antique is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone In an era when Twitter haiku messaging rules diplomacy moves at the speed and requires the nuanced complexity of literature Power has drifted from State to the National Security Council and the Pentagon especially in wartime Only a few of Clinton s recent predecessors have distinguished themselves Henry Kissinger a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State was Nixon s schizophrenic alter ego Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration Baker had clout because he was H W Bush s best friend and a world class dealmaker Most of the others have been frustrated or forgettable And yet this is Hillary Clinton we re talking about the second most popular American in the world an eternally compelling and supremely talented character the subject of constant speculation a walking headline Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more It is a clich to say that by naming Clinton Obama brought his most popular potential opponent the tent The conventional wisdom too cynical by half is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her a theory bolstered by Clinton s reticence during her first nine months on the job with special envoys like and doing the heavy lifting of diplomacy But by naming Clinton Obama also gave her great power which cuts both ways if she becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration s policies she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office had similar power and a real gripe the Iraq war but never used it Clinton has no such gripe but as the Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players the conundrum looms How will Clinton choose to use her power How will Obama react if and when she does Traditionally the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy negotiate deals and manage the striped pants bureaucracy Clinton has no history as a global strategist although her performance in the campaign indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian idealist It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator although her performance in Jerusalem indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling There are however three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State She brings a vision of departmental reform the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy that could change striped pants chinos in the developing world She is also the first elected politician to hold the office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration which has enabled her to better understand and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan But most important she is an international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability second only to the President s to change negative attitudes about the U S abroad She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U S has fielded in quite some time although her performance so far at home and abroad has occasionally been perplexing At home she has often seemed tentative and deferential In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Gates aired by CNN in early Clinton s cautious formality took a backseat to Gates brisk humorous confidence on policy issues Abroad she seems far more confident at times to the point of recklessness as in Jerusalem See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton s campaign Independence and Candor In the last week of Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage attempting at the behest of her special envoys to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists talks In the course of the trip there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her independence as the Administration facing roadblocks across the world struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King Can t we all just get along phase During her three days in Pakistan she ran a gauntlet of town hall meetings and media interviews that may have been unprecedented to use the word of the week for a U S Secretary of State The trip planned by and Pakistan specialist Vali Nasr offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U S diplomatic mission A visit to a Sufi mosque that had been bombed by Sunni extremists for example sent a powerful message to Pakistan s moderate Islamic majority We saw her praying there an academic named Shala Aziz told me and for the first time I m thinking The Americans have hearts See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students talk show hosts and Pashturi elders and that on occasion she pushed back raising incredibly sensitive issues like why no one in the Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was even though he had been in the country since Press accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State s getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton s undiplomatic bluntness But they missed the point her candor her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U S as arrogant and bossy more interested in having the Pakistani military fight its war against al Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership The contrast was especially sharp after W Bush s eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf In the past when the Americans came they would talk to the generals and go home said Farahnaz Ispahani a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament Clinton s willingness to meet with everyone hostile or not has made a big impression and because she s Hillary Clinton with a real history of affinity for this country it means so much more Transformative Experience There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan because there is no alcohol There are opening statements though and Clinton s delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes was surprisingly emotional Earlier in the day President Asif Ali Zardari the widower of Benazir Bhutto had presented the Secretary with an album of photos from her first visit to Pakistan in and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and daughter Chelsea It did bring tears to my eyes Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace because I so admired your wife She gave her life She faltered then choking up but quickly pulled herself together talking about the reasons why we do what we do to provide opportunities for all Clinton s first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in had been a transformative experience for her the beginning I believe of the process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State I traveled with her on that trip when we set off she seemed depressed and even more private than usual The Democrats had cratered in the congressional elections and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan It was a very personal defeat as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan crowds shouted her down and cursed her Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation it was Chelsea s spring break but also a retreat to a more demure First Lady like role after two years as health care policy czar although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky Hillarian fashion Kennedy had gone to India and famously ridden an elephant Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs That was the greatest trip just unbelievable Clinton says now We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her Jerusalem gaffe the Secretary in an electric blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants She was wearing glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I ve done since she said She emerged from the trip reinvigorated with a new mission By the end of at the U N Conference on Women in Beijing the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine Women s rights are human rights See photos of Beijing s changing skyline Clinton is not an easy interview She is preternaturally cautious a consequence of her Methodist propriety and years of insane public scrutiny She does not like to talk about herself but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto When her husband was governor of Arkansas she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside Bhutto s hotel waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar kameez with a chiffon scarf I was just a fan standing on the sidewalk with everyone else It was the only time I ever did anything like that Clinton says When Clinton and Bhutto met formally on the first day of the trip they hit it off immediately in part because Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children I remember asking Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past years and she said I used to be able to walk down the street wearing jeans without a headscarf Now I can t When I asked her why she said bluntly The Saudis who had been aggressively funding religious schools Of course Bhutto s acquiescence to and participation in the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so inadequate and madrasahs became popular See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto s assassination in Ironically the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al Qaeda has brought Clinton s interests microfinance education and health care to the center of national security policy for the first time The impetus came not from the State Department but from the military where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones schools justice economic development reinforce the military s efforts to secure the population As a result there was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General Petraeus author of the Army s counterinsurgency manual who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee At one point well before Obama made his presidential intentions known I asked Petraeus if there was any potential Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked and he said You mean aside from Hillary It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and my two alpha males she calls them for the first time at her home in Washington on the before the Obama Inauguration The affection and respect she gained for the military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than usual although Defense Secretary Gates insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn t hurt In fact relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother at times than Clinton s relationship with the White House staff Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID director Farmer from getting the job It was all sorts of niggling things says a Clinton adviser like Farmer had at one point brought more than in cash Haiti The money was for a needle exchange program but the amount was illegal Another of Clinton s military mentors retired General Jack Keane once told me I m a Republican I disagree with her about practically everything but she d make a hell of a Commander in Chief There is a palpable toughness to the woman a hard edge that contrasts with the President s instinctive impulse toward conciliation One of the sharpest exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the bluster of W Bush after she said the U S would be able to obliterate Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel Clinton s edgier tone has been evident from the start of the Administration she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli settlement freeze by claiming in that Obama wanted to see a stop to settlements Not some settlements not outposts not natural growth exceptions And then in Jerusalem her use of the word unprecedented seemed a rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules Read Clinton s Collateral Damage The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement But then the White House staff is several steps removed from a negotiating process The Palestinians are weak and divided The Israelis have been difficult as always whenever raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister the Israeli stands up and walks out of the room Despite Netanyahu s momentary tactical enthusiasm for peace talks his Likud Party has always favored the de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands the state of Israel Hillary s Choice The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward Obama and Clinton are in substantive agreement on the President s diplomacy first philosophy and on most policy issues although neither is willing to disclose the content of their private conversations but style often predicts substance in foreign policy neither Obama s gauziness nor Clinton s inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid There is a growing perception that the Administration s policies have been thwarted across the board Afghanistan is a mess Iran seems ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations there s no progress in the Middle East the Syrians and North Koreans remain recalcitrant the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense and the Chinese have been given a pass on human rights with no apparent quid pro quos The White House argues that some progress has been made Iran is on the defensive and North Korea has said it will return to the six party talks Clinton argues correctly about the need for strategic patience But the only thing Obama really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and no small thing the wisdom to have refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq The President has been willing to use military force the Predator drones that have decimated al Qaeda s leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness but this Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of U S power That doesn t happen overnight but for Obama s policies to be considered a success it has to happen sooner or later in a way that can be explained to the public There is also a growing sense that the President s inexperience is beginning to show not in his overall policy which represents the views of a broad moderate national security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to Kerry but in his execution of the details The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long the Middle East peace hunt has become a wild goose chase A letter to Iran s Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response if it doesn t it seems weak and supplicatory A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid You can t be seen pushing countries around demanding that Israel freeze settlements demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government and not get results says Leslie H Gelb author of Power Rules The leaders of these countries are tough successful politicians and they ll begin to take you less seriously See photos from the revolution in Iran Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes Her praise for the President is fulsome and aides say the relationship with Obama really really is strong But there are also burblings and emanations from Clinton s staff and friends Foggy Bottom body language that suggest there is a need for the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase And the White House is perplexed by the uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton s occasional overseas gaffes These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal creative policymaking There is absolutely no indication that the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New York as has been rumored Quite the contrary she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State To do that though she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad She will have to become the President s primary foreign policy voice Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration seven different Obama officials have spoken on the talk shows about foreign policy Clinton has been on each of the shows once Either you have one person sending the foreign policy message with the clear approval of the President says a former Republican Secretary of State or there is no message See photos from eight months of Obama s diplomacy Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the shows more often Indeed Clinton s staff acknowledged that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so Ultimately though television is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved How much can these former rivals both extremely guarded and private people really trust each other and if not Clinton who will emerge as the President s alter ego on foreign policy At this point the strongest member of Obama s national security team is Gates but he s a Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues General Jim has settled in as National Security Adviser but he s not a political animal and every President needs a close foreign policy adviser who understands the intersection of long term strategy politics and diplomatic chess Clinton s value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning the billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised How much damage control have you been able to do on this trip asked Meher Bokhari a television news show host at the end of Clinton s meeting with Pakistani women The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question I don t know she said I hope some Afterward I asked Bokhari to answer her own question Well this trip was long overdue she said The Pakistani people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns the strings attached to aid programs the drone attacks their history of support for the military dictatorship And it needs to be followed up But if you ask me about the damage control she paused thinking it through I d have to say a lot She accomplished a lot In the end though Clinton s success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat She will have to become a more sure handed negotiator and most important a trusted adviser to a President who knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn t quite figured out how to get there

2290,#s,WASHINGTON CNN Fewer than three in Americans think Sarah Palin s qualified to be president according to a new national poll the least of any of the five potential candidates included in the survey But another woman tops that list in the CNN Opinion Research Corporation survey released two thirds of the public thinks that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s qualified for the Oval Office That s more than Vice President Joe Biden who s currently next in line for the presidency According to the poll percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House with seven in saying the former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified The survey indicates that a majority of Republicans percent feel Palin is qualified with percent indicating she isn t But only percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president with percent disagreeing According to the poll nine in Democrats feel Palin is not qualified The poll s release comes one day before the release of Palin s book Going Rogue An American Life The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOP nomination in Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland According to the survey nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president with percent feeling the same way about Huckabee Among Republicans Palin is still lagging other potential primary candidates percent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified points higher than the number that say the same of Palin Palin has many strengths recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician that she cares about average Americans and that she is honest and trustworthy says Holland But the perception that she is not qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel An ABC News Washington Post poll also released indicates that percent of Americans say Palin s qualified to serve as president with six in saying she s not qualified The CNN survey indicates that percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office points higher than the percent of Americans who think that Biden s qualified to take over as president Biden s low number may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama Biden administration rather than views of Biden personally In the past poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president say Holland Polls from the late s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president but only if respondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications he adds In the Bush administration the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as the administration grew more unpopular Cheney s experience in office didn t change during that period attitudes toward the Bush Cheney administration did he says Hillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates including health care the economic stimulus and other controversial matters while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy Holland adds while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes which might explain why some respondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep The CNN Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted with adult Americans questioned by telephone The survey s sampling error is plus or minus percentage points for the overall sample

2306,Raj,ill Ex Gates Foundation exec named foreign aid chief Obama administration picks former Gates Foundation official to run US foreign aid By MATTHEW LEE Associated Press ij SINGAPORE AP The Obama administration will nominate a young former executive with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to run America s top foreign assistance program ending months of speculation and complaints about who would take the vacant post U S officials said President Barack Obama has chosen a medical doctor and currently a senior official at the Department of Agriculture dealing with food security to run the U S Agency for International Development the officials said The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending notification to Congress and a formal public announcement of the choice s selection which must still be confirmed by the Senate would end a month leadership vacuum at USAID which has been operating with an acting director since Obama took office despite his campaign pledges to have the agency play a greater role in foreign policy Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said USAID is crucial to deploying their preferred smart power foreign policy strategy which envisions more equal roles for diplomacy and development alongside defense They plan to double the amount of foreign aid The agency will play a key role in the administration s efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan where officials believe the civilian component must be strengthened But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now with several prime candidates withdrawing from consideration amid a White House vetting process that Clinton denounced in as ridiculous a nightmare and frustrating beyond words whose family immigrated to the U S from India is now the Under Secretary for Research Education and Economics and Chief Scientist at the Agriculture Department where he manages a budget of more than billion and more than staff around the world Before that he had several positions at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation including managing its billion contribution to a global vaccination fund and helping launch the foundation s Development program where he oversaw a billion investment portfolio The lingering USAID vacancy particularly after several leading candidates pulled out had upset development experts and Congress Some lawmakers had suggested that Obama choose someone who had already gone through the vetting process fits that bill and has important political credentials having worked with or for several leading Democratic politicians il

2333,"For H. And Doug, for WJC to ponder. Sid",Hillary This is the most provocative and significant analysis to come out of the recent election Its author is a right wing Republican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for Human Events I disagree with the ideological and partisan undercurrent of the piece especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather than the administration s lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people There is no reason why the deficit shouldn t become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered The pattern of the past is that the deficit the talisman of Hoover Republicans moves only partisan Republicans and that Democrats ascend if the economy is progressing its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universal impact That is not happening now This analysis therefore may be portentous Worth reading The electoral maps of VA don t show up in the email but they are described Sid Return to the Article Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama By Sean Trende Judis and Ruy Teixeira s well regarded work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in Virginia They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to upper middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters and manages to put together a winning coalition that if imitated in other states might put the Democrats in power for decades to come Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner s and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade Warner s coalition was essentially Bill Clinton s coalition The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily successful one for Democrats breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in and ultimately enabling the election of the most liberal President in American History last year Given this background it s only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in Virginia Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost of the vote the highest percentage though not the highest victory margin for any governor since The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins and the GOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly It could have been even worse five Democrats won their Assembly races by fewer than votes There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here After last week s election it s silly to argue that the GOP brand is too damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness And the Democrats latest spin that their weakness among Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their Republican voting habits puts the lie to the argument that Republicans low self identification is a salient factor in elections But the most important lesson is this while there s little predictive value in off year elections they do provide snapshots of the mood of the electorate and the present state of political coalitions Given Virginia s primacy in the story of Democratic coalition building it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition And it s not a pretty one for Democrats The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians Culturally conservative hawkish and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states They began breaking away from Democrats in the s and s their reaction to the Party s embrace of unions blacks and liberals is a story is so well known there s no need to rehash it here But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities liberals urban voters and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South who still preferred a moderate to conservative Democrat to a Republican This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board This was a huge innovation for Democrats suburbs like Nassau County NY Orange County CA and Fairfax County VA had fueled the rise of the Republican parties in those states Clinton moved them substantially toward his side This coalition allowed him to win by eight points in absent Perot and a last minute fundraising scandal he probably would have won by more Clinton intuited that suburban voters are generally speaking culturally cosmopolitan they don t like it when you call someone macaca and aren t crazy about the religious right But they re generally not particularly socially liberal either and are fans of law and order They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth but like good schools and a clean environment Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives balanced budgets are the ultimate good government indicator for these voters Clinton delivered on all of these issues keeping tax increases fairly small and balancing the budget for much of his term In so doing and this is very important he re branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility economic growth moderate taxes and smart government In other words he finally shed the Carter label for the Democrats This in turn made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him W Bush s presidency in turn was an upper middle class suburbanite s nightmare An aggressive social agenda a fiscal trainwreck two poorly managed wars and a financial collapse later these suburban voters trended even more heavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era By Democrats held most of the suburban districts around major metropolitan areas and were threatening in the exurbs The right Democratic candidate probably could have put together a massive Presidential majority combining minorities liberals Jacksonians Catholics and suburbanites The mood of the country was certainly right for a result But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama The party s grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the stage but they abandoned Obama completely Jay Cost and I have detailed this here This movement is why Obama received of the vote instead of the or so we might expect given the voters attitude toward Bush s Presidency Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the remaining portions of his base In other words while his base wasn t as broad as Clinton s it was deeper Faced with vanishing ks and home values and disgust with Bush s presidency suburbanites flocked to him Liberals were enthralled to finally elect one of their own And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black President But this presents a problem You only get to elect the first black President once and governing a coalition of suburbanites poor blacks and upper class liberals isn t easy It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up And with the Jacksonian wing of the party gone if that enthusiasm dissipates or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the door the party isn t left with much We see a microcosm of this story in last s elections especially in Virginia Let s backtrack to and look at the counties that Mark Warner won The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton s To oversimplify some it blended together rural Democrats in the mining counties in the west of the state college voters around Charlottesville and black voters combined with rural whites in the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast It was a diverse coalition but it worked Now let s compare Warner s map with Obama s map in The suburbs stayed in the Democrat s camp for reasons discussed above But look what happens in the west That area becomes solidly Republican Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis Mondale and Adlai Stevenson twice Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in during the s As I said this isn t a problem so long as the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than Obama and or the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats But we see indications in Virginia that the Jacksonian divorce may in fact be permanent Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state and seemed at least on paper capable of remaking the Mark Warner map It didn t happen obviously Let s look at how Virginia changed from Bush s election to Deeds loss last week The redder a county is the more it moved toward the Republicans from to bluer counties moved toward Democrats We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs but no better Those pockets of white are the DC suburbs in the northeast the Hampton Roads area in the southeast and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton Roads Its rural Virginia which is still about of the electorate that made the difference between Bush s in and McDonnell s on Even with Obama off the ticket and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the ticket rural Virginia went solidly Republican We can take another angle here Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in Let s compare Deeds showing to his performance NOTE In this map we look at relative movement Because everything in the state moved toward McDonnell a map just showing movement would be solid dark red and not of much use So instead if something moved more than points toward McDonnell it is colored a shade of red if it moved less than points toward McDonnell it is blue Think of this as showing the change in the counties PVI We see the same result Just since rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats The suburbs haven t moved much at all relative to the rest of the state while the more heavily African American counties in the southern portion of the state have moved a few notches leftward in absolute terms they voted in as they had in This suggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama Now let s look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in Again because the movement here was so dramatic statewide we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at relative shifts The western counties of the state didn t shift much from but that s because they were already giving Republicans around of the vote there wasn t much room for Republican growth and remember blue in a relative map still means slight movement toward the Republican since The real Republican gains over the past year have come in the DC exurbs in the corridor and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area In other words the Jacksonians aren t returning to the Democrats at least in Virginia Deeds might still have been able to win without them but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs In other words two pieces of the Clinton Warner coalition are starting to break away This is a real problem for the Democrats If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party there is very very little left for them And there s reason to think that the suburban weakness is real Obama s fiscal policy to make an understatement hasn t been Clintonian It may not be entirely his fault but the billion stimulus the trillion dollar healthcare bill the automobile bailout and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade make suburbanites shudder They don t much like debt and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at some point probably by them Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt as they do most Presidents in their first year but they are becoming very very worried and probably don t put much stock in Candidate Obama s promise to enact a net spending cut any more Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds inept campaign Deeds wasn t a great candidate but when the mood of the country is starting to swing against your party it is hard to run a good campaign Jerry Kilgore found this out when he ran in a similar environment in and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death penalty And if you run the Deeds McDonnell race in or I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by points even holding everything else equal The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country Most of the seats in the House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia or came close to losing were suburban The Philly suburbs voted Republican for the state Supreme Court Bergen County New Jersey didn t give the Republican of the vote like it did in but Chris Christie nearly carried it and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Whitman or Tom Kean he won the largest margin for a first term Republican Governor since Conservative Republicans won elections in Westchester County New York and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the outskirts of Queens Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature the Democrats capture of that body figures prominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive there with an obscure underfunded candidate In other words in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen his attack ads on McDonell s thesis the Democrats still lost suburban voters States with a Democratic base of liberals urbanites and minority voters like California and New York haven t moved much against Democrats Obama s polling numbers as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and Senator in classic Emerging Democratic Majority states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all And of course in Jacksonian states like Kentucky he s below This doesn t mean that Democrats are doomed in An improved economy Republican missteps and a host of other factors could keep the band together for them Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls to enact hope and change will return in to keep hope alive But the personal nature of Obama s victory is starting to show its downside for downticket Democrats The Clinton coalition is looking creaky If Obama doesn t improve and the coalition comes apart Democrats could find themselves weaker than they were even in the s and s Sean Trende can be reached at strende realclearpolitics com Page Printed from http www

such an easy and delicious target for the missteps But State s role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central and the department s senior Asia hand surely knew better It s also hard to

President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Now that would truly clear the air and open the door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration s decision making machinery Every decision large and small is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by a deputy NSC adviser and the administration s Lord High Executioner Does Obama get enough pushback Is he hearing a range of views Can he see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience If Mr Obama reflects on the Asia journey and other mishaps he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside counselors or outside advisers Amateur Hour at the White House by Leslie H Gelb I pm The Asia trip was not worth Obama s time Leslie H Gelb on why the president should shake up his foreign policy team and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home President Obama s nine day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems past and future First the trip s limited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America s power On top of the inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations the message for Mr Obama should be clear He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign policy team and more so at his own dominant role in decision making Something is awry somewhere and he s got to fix it Secondly the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world s most dynamic economic region and Mr Obama missed it He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralism and mutual understanding He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and trade problems Otherwise most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week s commentary Unbelievably some criticized Obama for not getting China to throw its weight around What Asian leaders want that None that I know of Others lamented that Obama couldn t make demands on China anymore The presumption here is that China is now king and that Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around and that China is not now ruling the roost more accurately it s sitting on its own eggs Others contended that Obama continued his pattern of trashing America s friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China It s hard to stomach this nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised W Bush for accommodating China and alienating America s allies Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect deliverables on the trip and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia s new importance and America s desire for a new co operative spirit That s a commendable thought but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president s time when you consider preparations especially when he s got a tanking economy health care reform woes and decisions to make on Afghanistan Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments on certain issues that can t be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit In fact most presidents wouldn t even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during the visit itself The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals Just take a gander at trips planned for Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for H W Bush by Baker Obama s travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse gas emissions and the fate of U S bases on Okinawa which the new Japanese government insists on moving It was time to announce ways to gain fixes on the U S South Korean trade treaty long stalled in Congress It was a moment to show that Beijing would actually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these Mr Obama should have taken a well deserved vacation in Hawaii Matters were made worse on the scene It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan s emperor He seems to do this stuff spontaneously and inexplicably as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago And it was truly unfortunate that Obama and his aides didn t flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television and meet with non stacked Chinese groups as has been the case during previous presidential visits Beijing s leaders obviously didn t feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr Obama such access But he and his team should have made it a precondition of the visit Its absence left an unhappy taste The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world s most dynamic economic region and Mr Obama missed it The White House might try to blame the State Department such an easy and delicious target for the missteps But State s role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central and the department s senior Asia hand surely knew better It s also hard to tar the National Security Council s own senior Asia expert Jeff Bader another pro like Perhaps even higher officials at the

Obama reflects on the Asia journey and other mishaps he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside counselors or outside advisers If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip here s what they would have advised Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation and stop invoking the God of Multilateralism without spelling out America s leadership role Asia is now overflowing with multilateral organizations Washington is a member of a few key ones like Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asian Development Bank But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Russia China Uzbekistan etc and ASEAN the association of Southeast Asian nations Asian nations are increasingly organizing themselves these groups and Washington hasn t really figured out its role Most Asian nations want that role to be a prominent one in fact the leadership position They re afraid of China afraid that China won t be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past At the same time they don t want Washington to come these groupings and cause problems with Beijing They want Washington to figure out a leadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest They want an America they remember one that can get things done and doesn t let problems fester That U S policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama s trip Washington played architect and solidified its leadership in Europe after World War II with NATO the Plan and various trade and economic organizations like the World Bank Asian nations are yearning

Sid,H If Roubini is right and he s been mostly right so far one of the few then without additional and large stimulus devoted to putting a floor on job loss the pressure on protectionism will be far more intense Protectionism by any name should not be dismissed as a targeted tool in an ongoing policy to force China to revalue its currency The US is not without means here The deficit will be high in any case and the Republicans will always attempt to exploit it no matter what its number Whether another stimulus can pass Congress is another matter Still what matters in the short run and long run are achievable results To most people the deficit is an abstraction employment and housing and insecurity about both are their vital concrete and immediate issues Sid http www nydailynews com opinions the worst is yet to come unemployed americans should hunker down for more job lo html The worst is yet to come Unemployed Americans should hunker down for more job losses BY Nouriel Roubini th AM Think the worst is over Wrong Conditions in the U S labor markets are awful and worsening While the official unemployment rate is already and another jobs were lost in when you include discouraged workers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping While losing jobs per month is better than the jobs lost in current job losses still average more than the per month rate of during the last recession Also remember The last recession ended in but job losses continued for more than a year and half until of ditto for the recession So we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of at the earliest In other words if you are unemployed and looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner you had better hunker down All the economic numbers suggest this will take a while The jobs just are not coming back There s really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with another round of labor intensive shovel ready infrastructure projects helps fiscally strapped state and local governments and provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers Helping the unemployed just by extending unemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation The long term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest Now as a way of sharing the pain many firms are telling their workers to cut hours take furloughs and accept lower wages Specifically that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another million full time jobs lost on top of the million jobs formally lost This is very bad news but we must face facts Many of the lost jobs are gone forever including construction jobs finance jobs and manufacturing jobs Recent studies suggest that a quarter of U S jobs are fully out sourceable over time to other countries Other measures tell the same ugly story The average length of unemployment is at an all time high the ratio of job applicants to vacancies is to initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions of unemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer Based on my best judgment it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to and will remain at a very high level for two years or more The weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and an anemic recovery of the economy and increases the risk of a double dip recession As a result of these terribly weak labor markets we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth larger budget deficits greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home and commercial real estate prices greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estate mortgages and in credit cards auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks and greater protectionist pressures The damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now Roubini is professor of Economics at the School of Business at New York University and Chairman of Roubini Economics Read more http www nydailynews com opinions the worst is yet to come unemployed americans should hunker down for more job lo html print paqe all i xzz WwHGikNI

2349,FYI: This CFR analysis clears away fundamental misperceptions on US-China. Sid,Council on Foreign Relations Expert Brief The U S China Economic Relationship Separating Facts from Myths Steven Dunaway Adjunct Senior Fellow for International Economics Author Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund Author of the Council Report Imbalances and the Financial Crisis http www cfr org publication uschina economic relationship html breadcrumb Fregion F Fchina Many myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China Four in particular stand out and it is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions The fact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U S government securities is taken as indicating that the United States is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits Similarly since China is a major source for U S imports U S consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods In addition the Chinese authorities have emphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability in China is bad with adverse implications for the rest of the world Taken together these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States or other major countries to more quickly change its policies especially its exchange rate policy to facilitate the rebalancing of its economy But such a conclusion would be a major mistake and that is why during his trip to Asia President Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes in China This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G summit in Pittsburgh in Myth No Washington has limited leverage because China is the main banker for the United States China holds a large amount of U S government securities Of China s trillion in official reserves it is estimated that percent is held in U S dollar assets China is a big customer for U S debt but it is not America s banker Nor is the United States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits If China elects not to buy U S Treasuries there are other willing public and private sector buyers as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide Although the U S government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in the event that the Chinese reduce their demand the increase in interest rates would likely be small Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U S Treasury securities would depend on the reason behind the decision It would be in China s best interest and beneficial for the rest of the world as well if China reduced its purchases of U S Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greater flexibility in the currency s movements This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance its economy and be able to sustain rapid growth China is a big customer for U S debt but it is not America s banker Nor is the United States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate it will build up large additional amounts of official reserves If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U S Treasury securities then China will increase its purchases of assets denominated in other currencies with euro denominated securities being the most likely alternative In these circumstances China would continue to intervene in its exchange market with the central bank buying U S dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets The result would be an appreciation of the euro Consequently countries in Europe not the United States would probably be most affected by China s move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweigh the effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries Alternatively China could choose to start dumping its stock of U S securities The result would be appreciation of other major currencies depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets upward pressure on U S interest rates and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U S dollar assets rapidly However the U S Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U S interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent market disruptions But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself The country would incur a substantial capital loss on its reserve assets The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss and are very unlikely to decide to dump U S assets In fact the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternative official reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U S dollar holdings Myth No The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goods This is not really true Only roughly percent of U S imports come from China Moreover all of the basic types of manufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States clothing textiles footwear toys small appliances etc can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically The prices for goods that could substitute for products from China would be higher but the difference in costs would be relatively small Competition among producers has become fiercer and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers are narrowing Dependence actually runs the other way China is highly dependent on U S demand for its products Economic growth in China is heavily dependent on exports Although China has been able to achieve its percent GDP growth target in owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions the country will struggle to meet this objective in and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up Myth No External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate While no country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure the truth is that if there is no pressure there is less incentive to change policy This is especially true in China where the authorities are wedded to the status quo because of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies Recent developments in China s exchange rate illustrate this point In the absence of external pressure since China has reverted to fixing its exchange rate relative to the U S dollar Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis changes in China s policies are likely to be delayed and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world Myth No Instability is bad for China Chinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effects on China s growth rate But instability or the fear of instability has played a big role in initiating economic policy changes in China For example concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has been a major factor behind new initiatives to develop China s interior such as the Develop the West program and to improve conditions and opportunities for the rural population including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment of migrant workers Hence for China instability is not necessarily bad but it is a problem for the authorities Instability in China also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China s growth Although China accounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth the country does not generate much demand for products from other countries given China s large trade and current account surpluses Some countries in Asia and commodity producers may be benefiting from China s strong growth but overall it is not providing much stimulus for the world economy as a whole so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chinese authorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship The president should not shy away from pushing the Chinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China s economy but this should be done in his private discussions with China s senior leaders Multilateral discussions such as those in the context of the G process are a much more effective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China s economic policies jointly with other major economies Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis changes in China s policies are likely to be delayed and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world It also is not in the best interest of China because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth toward greater reliance on consumption China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development Getting China to fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the United States and other major economies

2412,Re: Happy New Year!,Krugman in case you haven t seen Op Ed Columnist Chinese New Year By PAUL KRUGMAN It s the season when pundits traditionally make predictions about the year ahead Mine concerns international economics I predict that will be the year of China And not in a good way Actually the biggest problems with China involve climate change But today I want to focus on currency policy China has become a major financial and trade power But it doesn t act like other big economies Instead it follows a mercantilist policy keeping its trade surplus artificially high And in today s depressed world that policy is to put it bluntly predatory Here s how it works Unlike the dollar the euro or the yen whose values fluctuate freely China s currency is pegged by official policy at about yuan to the dollar At this exchange rate Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantage over its rivals leading to huge trade surpluses Under normal circumstances the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China s currency unless it was offset by private investors heading the other way And private investors are trying to get China not out of it But China s government restricts capital inflows even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad adding to a trillion plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves This policy is good for China s export oriented state industrial complex not so good for Chinese consumers But what about the rest of us In the past China s accumulation of foreign reserves many of which were invested in American bonds was arguably doing us a favor by keeping interest rates low although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate a housing bubble But right now the world is awash in cheap money looking for someplace to go Short term interest rates are close to zero long term interest rates are higher but only because investors expect the zero rate policy to end some day China s bond purchases make little or no difference Meanwhile that trade surplus drains much needed demand away from a depressed world economy My back of the envelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U S employment by around million jobs The Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem Recently Wen Jiabao the prime minister dismissed foreign complaints On one hand you are asking for the yuan to appreciate and on the other hand you are taking all kinds of protectionist measures Indeed other countries are taking modest protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let its currency rise And more such measures are entirely appropriate Or are they I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies Neither holds water First there s the claim that we can t confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U S economy by dumping their hoard of dollars This is all wrong and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses on themselves The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also mean that China has little or no financial leverage Again right now the world is awash in cheap money So if China were to start selling dollars there s no reason to think it would significantly raise U S interest rates It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies but that would be good not bad for U S competitiveness and employment So if the Chinese do dump dollars we should send them a thank you note
2413,"Oh, my—and , thankfully, Happy New year!",Thank you for such a lovely note Life seems very sweet indeed this New Year s Day and all the more so with the privilege of doing meaningful and important work with a great team of people and a leader whom I am proud to serve It has been quite a journey indeed one that has been hard at times but immensely rewarding Happy New Year and here s to a great AM

2425,(no subject),Cover story in the Economist this week Very big issue when I was in Japan and Korea Korean parliamentarians want to get women and economic growth on the G agenda when they have the lead next year and we are advocating for Japan to advance the issue at APEC which they are leading this year On another note so sad about Bagley He was a good person and was one of your biggest fans Women and work We did it Dec th From The Economist print edition The rich world s quiet revolution women are gradually taking over the workplace Getty Images AT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration here is a candidate within the next few months women will cross the threshold and become the majority of the American workforce Women already make up the majority of university graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional workers in several rich countries including the United States Women run many of the world s great companies from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France Women s economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our times Just a generation ago women were largely confined to repetitive menial jobs They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to abandon their careers when they married and had children Today they are running some of the organisations that once treated them as second class citizens Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives And millions of brains have been put to more productive use Societies that try to resist this trend most notably the Arab countries but also Japan and some southern European countries will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent and frustrated citizens This revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction see article Men have by and large welcomed women s invasion of the workplace Yet even the most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory This particular advance comes with two stings The first is that women are still under represented at the top of companies Only of the bosses of America s largest companies and of their peers in Britain are women They are also paid significantly less than men on average The second is that juggling work and child rearing is difficult Middle class couples routinely complain that they have too little time for their children But the biggest losers are poor children particularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of female participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money on child care Dealing with the juggle These two problems are closely related Many women feel they have to choose between their children and their careers Women who prosper in high pressure companies during their s drop out in dramatic numbers in their s and then find it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum Less skilled women are trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand to mouth child care arrangements Motherhood not sexism is the issue in America childless women earn almost as much as men but mothers earn significantly less And those mothers relative poverty also disadvantages their children Demand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems Even if some of the new theories about warm hearted women making inherently superior workers are bunk see article several trends favour the more educated sex including the war for talent and the growing flexibility of the workplace Law firms consultancies and banks are rethinking their up or out promotion systems because they are losing so many able women More than of companies in Germany and Sweden allow flexible working And new technology is making it easier to redesign work in all sorts of family friendly ways Women have certainly performed better over the past decade than men In the European Union women have filled m of the m new jobs created since In America three out of four people thrown out of work since the mancession began have been male And the shift towards women is likely to continue by there will be m more female than male university students in America The light hand of the state All this argues mostly for letting the market do the work That has not stopped calls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort Norway has used threats of quotas to dramatic effect Some of the legislators there are women All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state financed nurseries They have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of the social problems that plague Britain and America Surely comes the argument there is a way to speed up the revolution and improve the tough lives of many working women and their children If that means massive intervention in the shape of affirmative action programmes and across the board benefits for parents of all sorts the answer is no To begin with promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and unfair and stigmatises its beneficiaries And there are practical problems Lengthy periods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women which helps explain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a lower proportion of women in management than America does But there are plenty of cheaper subtler ways in which governments can make life easier for women Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at home They need to change the way they operate German schools for instance close at midday American schools shut down for two months in the summer These things can be changed without huge cost Some popular American charter schools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays And without going to Scandinavian lengths America could invest more in its children it spends a lower share of its GDP on public child care than almost any other rich country and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid maternity leave Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric about real family values Still these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that women have made in recent decades During the second world war when America s menfolk were off at the front the government had to summon up the image of Rosie the Riveter with her flexed muscle and We Can Do It slogan to encourage

2456,The Next Six Months - Work Plan,I Introduction The next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department s leadership in bridging relationships for U S intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts defining the mission and role of the Office of the for S SRGIA and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the Department and these officials Our approach will be strategic and integrated working in collaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the Secretary s and Administration s priorities II Key Objectives The for will serve the global needs of the U S intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent The S SRGIA will also connect U S state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country led processes and facilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with Department priorities III Next Steps This work plan describes activities that the S SRGIA plans to initiate grow and implement in the next six months To place the Work Plan in context we describe below S SRGIA s work planning process A Establish S SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department Currently no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the needs of intergovernmental officials e g Governors Mayors local elected leaders the entities that represent them with respect to their global affairs portfolios State and local officials concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting the priority of the person in the bureau s estimation or the nature of the request Priority activities will be as follows Sensitive But Unclassified Confirm the Secretary s support to focus on priority issues and countries Join Department s meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and local representatives and dignitaries to establish S SRGIA s role Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the State Department by explaining the value of these stakeholders Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage the State Department s collective U S and global intergovernmental relationships Follow and interpret international issues e g food security global health climate change trade and economic development energy of importance to state governments Promote dialogue between the Department e g USAID EEB ECA Public Private Partnerships Women s Issues Consular MCC and targeted Regional Bureaus and external constituents e g Governors Mayors local elected officials and the entities that they represent for more effective partnerships and relationships and Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreign intergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U S intergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further their global goals B Conduct Stakeholder Outreach Obtain first hand understanding of the needs of U S intergovernmental officials State economies are increasingly globalized and more and more U S companies are competing in international markets and against firms worldwide As the principal stewards of their states economic success Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents both challenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continued competitiveness Thus S SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and international organizations U S national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following National Governors Association National Lt Governors Association U S Conference of Mayors National League of Cities National Association of Counties Large Urban County Caucus National Association of States Attorney Generals National State Legislatures and Councils of State Governments Outreach is essential to many aspects of the Department s activities S SRGIA s outreach objective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the State Department efforts in global intergovernmental affairs especially among decision makers and policy makers educational entities non governmental organizations public interest groups and public agencies S SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local elected officials in all states the District of Columbia Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U S territories Specific objectives are to Sensitive But Unclassified Build state by state profiles thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunities for collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Department priorities Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships with principals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs Create dialogue with the Governors and Mayors in preparation for the NGA and Mayors Washington conferences in the fall Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroad required to implement the Department s global intergovernmental affairs agenda Develop a network of leaders to collaborate and create partnerships Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum of Understandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsible parties and Collaboration with EEB to partner with them to engage state and local government leaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts e g the Administration s National Export Initiative and EEB Consular Business Visa Facilitation initiative etc C Conduct Stakeholder Outreach Obtain first hand understanding of the needs of middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials Currently ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign and domestic government officials None of ECA s programs target regions with the objective of enhancing another country s government systems because the bureau s authorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under the auspices of enhancing mutual understanding The most visible ECA program is the International Visitor Leadership Program which in FY brought in foreign government officials at the state city and national levels to gain knowledge around the US political system and culture To date the bureau estimates the same number of government visitors in FY Thus S SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in partnership with international organizations International organizations who serve local governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following United Cities and Local Governments Metropolis The World Urban Forum UN HABITAT Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of Housing and Urbanization UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities The World Mayors Council on Climate Change Sensitive But Unclassified Sister Cities International Local Governments for Sustainability and Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa Priority activities will be as follows S SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreach with strategic countries e g Af Pak Iraq and key emerging powers Brazil India Indonesia South Africa Nigeria and developing countries Rwanda Ethiopia Kenya etc to obtain first hand understanding of the needs of middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials Collaborate with NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of what foreign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their US counterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns opportunities programs and connections D Provide Leadership for Department Capacity Building One of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in the government below the President and Prime Minister level As the Department seeks to implement development programs or conduct diplomacy there is often limited local counterpart capacity to do so with or to empower S SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus and offices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity of intergovernmental officials in countries around the world Currently millions of dollars of USAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractors and have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact S SRGIA will partner with existing offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space accountability for the outcomes and programming and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here in the US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed S SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derived from studying successful and less successful approaches Within the next six months S SRGIA will work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources Priority activities will be as follows Identify State Department investments canvass additional State Department dedicated resources other than grant making and assess the strength of the current environment needed to advance the S SRGIA s Secretary capacity building agenda for state and local leaders participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda Develop an agenda for a high level retreat on the formulation of a National Capacity Development Strategy to present achievements to date lessons learned and proposals for institutional capacity development going forward Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacity building is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development efforts Sensitive But Unclassified Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacity development by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public private partnerships Prioritize discrete initiatives to fast track based on importance regional priorities e g Asia Africa and Latin America assessment of readiness impact and feasibility and translate priorities actionable interventions Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity building initiatives related to global intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIA capacity building initiative and Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on their projects and Department priorities IV Administrative Activities Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy business trade consular affairs etc and Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development office websites V Budget and Staffing S SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission VI Assessment of Progress The short term goal will be to engage U S intergovernmental officials about their global concerns The S SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high level State Department engagement for U S state and local elected officials The benefits of this new office will be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens Assisting US states and local governments to expand their exports promote locations for foreign investment and for participation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope to achieve with respect to U S intergovernmental officials With respect to the global intergovernmental officials in the short term we expect to work with our Regional Bureaus and Offices e g USAID ECA EEB etc to assess the current state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to this constituency In the longer term institutionally we need to sustain relationships with our embassies and missions overseas so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies to expand their global business base As related to our national capacity building strategy in the long term we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officials abroad We also seek accountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provide leadership for future investments Going forward we will tailor these investments to address regional State Department priorities Sensitive But Unclassified In addition since there is a lack of USG harmonization of all of the relevant USG programs having S SRGIA be the designated coordinator will allow DOS to take the lead in synchronizing government wide programs that engage foreign government officials This will be another long term goal for the office VII Potential Events A Potential Events and Activities for S Private Dinner or Luncheon with the Governors and Urban Mayors Roundtable or Speech at USCMNGA Winter Meetings and Recommendations of Governors and Mayors for S to extend possible invitations for occasional international travel with S B Potential Events and Activities SRGIA Host Day with State with U

2467,RE: Abu Mazen,Will do
2468,RE: Abu Mazen,Will do Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM s name Today my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace the Palestinians and the Arab world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill Well the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and a new future for our children and for their children Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago we have been calling for direct negotiations with the Palestinians During that time we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development These actions have helped spur a surge a boom in the Palestinian economy At the same time the security environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing settlements I said we would also restrain settlement activity and that s exactly what we decided to do today I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens our brothers and sisters who live in Judea and Samaria That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway It will not include the schools kindergartens synagogues and public buildings necessary for the continuation of normal life over the time period of the suspension Obviously any infrastructure that may be needed to protect our national security or to safeguard the lives of our citizens will also be provided during this time Regarding Jerusalem our sovereign capital our position is well known We do not put any restrictions on building in our sovereign capital As always we are committed to protect freedom of worship for all faiths and to ensure equal and fair treatment for all the city s residents Jews and Arabs alike When the suspension ends my government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to construction I want to say clearly to the Palestinians Now is the time to begin negotiations Now is the time to move the peace process forward There is no more time to waste Israel has taken a far reaching step for peace It s time for the Palestinians to do the same

2511,Reuters piece,Sorry meant to send earlier China sees no chance of climate deal source Thu Dec Print I Single Page By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison COPENHAGEN Reuters China has told participants in the U N climate change talks that it sees no possibility of achieving an operational accord this week an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the conference and had hoped to sign on a new pact to tackle global warming The official who asked not to be identified told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing a short political declaration of some sort but it was not clear what that would say The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational agreement to be signed The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue U S President Barack Obama has called for an operational accord essentially a political agreement with teeth that can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is hammered out in Some ministers warned that slow often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure We may not get there on the substance it is quite possible we ll fail on the substance but at least let s give it a try said Britain s energy and climate minister Ed Miliband At the moment the problem is we re not giving it a try Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions how deep the cuts should be and how much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world While the overall picture is bleak there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations and Japan pledged about billion billion pound in public funds to to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions Talks on a U N backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced and the United States pledged billion in short term funds to conserve tropical forests A major sticking point between the world s top emitters the United States and China has been the question of how they will prove they are sticking to emission curbing plans On China s climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse to set up trade barriers Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports from countries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming

2519,Wash. Post. today re Palau & Uighurs,Want to make sure you saw the front page story below It s really about the tragedy of brothers wrongfully detained at Guantanamo but it makes clear that Palau is doing the U S a great service and has been more courageous in this regard than most of the world although Palau is in many ways more vulnerable to China The Secretary complimenting Pres Toribiong re this was a good move right after Alcy upset the Palauans as you feared in a meeting I will give you a confidential report on separately Jeff Brothers Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo To Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning Family By Del Quentin Wilber Washington Post Staff Writer Bahtiyar Mahnut a detainee at the U S military prison at Guantanamo Bay learned a few weeks ago that the Pacific island nation of Palau had invited him to settle there It should have been cause for celebration especially for a man who desperately wants to be free But to the surprise of his attorneys Bahtiyar has turned down the offer He wishes to remain a prisoner they say so he can look after his older brother a fellow detainee The brothers saga as related by their attorneys and military records could transpire only in the context of Guantanamo Bay and comes at a critical juncture for the Obama administration which is struggling to meet a Jan deadline to shutter the detainee prison Their circumstances also highlight the diplomatic difficulties facing the U S government as it tries to find places to send prisoners not destined for terrorism trials in the United States The brothers are Uighurs residents of China who are considered separatists by Beijing but are not enemies of the United States The brothers were picked up separately in Afghanistan and Pakistan soon after the United States launched attacks against al Qaeda and the Taliban in retaliation for the Sept attacks Since at least the U S government has tried to find homes for the brothers and other captured Uighurs Five went to Albania in four were sent to Bermuda in At one point U S officials were considering the possibility of resettling Uighurs in the D C region but that plan was scuttled under political pressure Most countries have been reluctant to accept Uighurs and risk angering China In recent weeks however Palau has agreed to accept of the remaining Uighurs according to the Justice Department The only detainee not invited by Palau was Bahtiyar s older brother Arkin Mahmud who has developed mental health problems that are apparently too serious to be treated in the sparsely populated country said his attorney Elizabeth Gilson To make matters worse according to Gilson and military records Arkin is a prisoner only because he went searching for Bahtiyar after the younger brother left their homeland eight years ago This is just very difficult and sad said Abubakkir Qasim a Uighur freed from Guantanamo Bay in who considers himself a friend of both brothers Bahtiyar is turning away freedom for his brother Qasim said through an interpreter His brother is only there because of Bahtiyar I feel sorry for both of them Five other Uighurs have declined the offer for a variety of reasons according to one of their attorneys Baker Manning The Justice Department says the government thinks that six to eight Uighurs will go to Palau The earliest they could leave would be the Justice Department says Officials at the Defense and State departments and the Palau Embassy in Washington either declined to comment or did not return phone messages In Bahtiyar and Arkin both Muslims were living with their parents and a younger brother in a small house in bustling Ghulja in Western China Arkin is the father of two children then and The brothers were not particularly devout but felt oppressed by the government of Beijing which does not allow worship and ensures the best jobs go to ethnic Chinese The brothers were forced to survive as menial tradesmen Bahtiyar sold clothes Arkin repaired shoes Bahtiyar wanted to strike out on his own So with in his pocket he headed for Pakistan But he quickly ran out of money and couldn t find work He was worried about being sent back to China until a friend told him about a group of Uighurs in Afghanistan that wanted to fight against the Chinese government If I went he told military officials I didn t have to pay for food or anything So I went to Afghanistan There he lived with other Uighurs in a camp of dusty roads and shacks in the southern mountains The group built houses and a mosque They trained with one automatic rifle and did some push ups pull ups and other calisthenics records show Within a few weeks of arriving at the camp Bahtiyar managed to call home His mother was very worried and told Arkin to find his brother He left because he was a dutiful son Gilson said After the Sept attacks the U S military began bombing Afghanistan and destroyed Bahtiyar s camp sending the Uighurs the mountains for shelter Bahtiyar and others crossed neighboring Pakistan where they were arrested and turned over to U S authorities Meanwhile Arkin made his way to Afghanistan where he was captured by the Northern Alliance and turned over the United States At a military prison in Kandahar the brothers saw each other across the razor wire In the military brought the brothers and other Uighurs to Guantanamo Bay Authorities alleged at the time that the men trained at military style camps affiliated with the Taliban or al Qaeda The accusations later dissolved upon close scrutiny by the courts Arkin and Bahtiyar were confined in separate cells and for months were not able to talk A Uighur interpreter working for the military Rushan Abbas persuaded the military in to allow the brothers to meet in an interrogation room When they saw each other they hugged and wept It was just so emotional Abbas said These brothers from across the world coming together in an interrogation room for the first time In Arkin remained in solitary confinement He had a record of disciplinary infractions and had been disrespectful to the guards records show Not for the first time Bahtiyar took steps to help his brother Living in a more relaxed part of the prison he was granted a request to be moved to Arkin s camp I missed my brother so much he told military officials By the next year the brothers had been cleared for release by the military The government did not present any evidence to justify their detention in a federal lawsuit brought the Uighurs seeking their freedom In a judge ordered them freed the United States but that decision was overturned on appeal The Uighurs are awaiting word expected this week on whether the Supreme Court will hear the case Last year the remaining Uighurs were moved to a fenced in camp that includes an activities room video games and books Through it all Arkin and Bahtiyar have struggled to cope with being prisoners perhaps for years to come I know I ll die in here Arkin told Gilson not long ago In China at least I would have a trial and sentence Since taking their case in Gilson has met with Arkin dozens of times But she had only spoken to Bahtiyar by phone He had refused to meet with her frustrated by lawyers always talking about what he considered fruitless legal victories Two weeks ago he changed his mind Bahtiyar felt that he owed her an explanation for refusing Palau s generous offer Every day here is an eternity he told Gilson through an interpreter But I have to look out for my brother L

2539,Sen. Levin,Levin opposed the surge but voted for funding the troops Pasted below is Levin s speech on troops in Afghanistan We ll have a copy for you as well Afghan speech below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact Senator Levin s Office Phone Senate Floor Speech Surge the Afghan Army Remarks as prepared for delivery Today we mark a solemn anniversary Eight years ago this morning our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists motivated by hatred and bent on destruction It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day the innocent lives lost and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan the nation that hosted those terrorists cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us But today is an especially appropriate occasion to take stock of those efforts and consider how best to continue them I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted Kaufman The situation in Afghanistan is serious Security has deteriorated But if we take the right steps we can ensure that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al Qaeda to terrorize us and the world The Obama administration s new strategy focusing on securing the Afghan population s safety and partnering with the Afghan security forces in that effort is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan The change in strategy has led our forces in the words of General McChrystal s Counterinsurgency Guidance to live eat and train together with the Afghan security forces plan and operate together depend on one another and hold each other accountable and treat them as equal partners in success The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan security forces is our goal To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts to become self sufficient in delivering security to their nation before we consider whether to increase U S combat forces above the levels already planned for the next few months These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan Army and police much faster than presently planned providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than presently planned providing them more equipment than presently planned and working to separate local Taliban fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened we still have important advantages there The Afghan people hate the Taliban Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about In addition the Afghan army is highly motivated and its troops are proven fighters Despite those advantages we face significant challenges General McChrystal believes and I agree that we need to regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success General McChrystal worries and rightly so about the perception that we have lost that initiative and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people their government al Qaeda and the Taliban By contrast if we can dispel that perception we have a chance to convince local and lower level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that Afghanistan s army and police have the manpower equipment and support to secure their own nation First we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned There are approximately troops in the Afghan army now and that number is scheduled to go up to by of The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of by the same time For a long time many of us have urged the establishment of a goal of Afghan troops and Afghan police by The Afghan Minister of Defense has strongly supported those numbers It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are prepared to accept those goals But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent I believe it both possible and essential to advance those goals by a year to Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces In one sector of Helmand province we visited last week our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by to one A Marine Company commander in Helmand province told the New York Times in that a lack of Afghan troops is absolutely our Achilles heel What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police According to Afghan Defense Minister Wardak there is no lack of Afghan manpower we ve been assured it is available But we will need significantly more trainers We asked General Formica who is in charge of the American effort to train Afghan security forces whether such an increase is possible He indicated he would make an assessment of what would be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable In the meantime we should also press our NATO allies with much greater forcefulness to provide more trainers If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces they have pledged at least they could provide additional trainers Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid level Afghan officers In addition to supporting efforts to graduate more Afghan officers from army academies we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister Wardak that previous mid level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated and while they may not be trained in the most current tactics they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group of officers is trained A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure such a barracks While the available infrastructure may not be the most modern it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment There must be a major effort to transfer a significant amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police Such a significant commitment to equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U S determination to take the initiative and create momentum in the right direction There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq our military is calling it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world s history A significant part of it could be transferred to the Afghan forces increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness And yet there does not seem to be that kind of a crash effort in place to do that We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq Rapidly expanding Afghanistan s military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now face there General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in capabilities that brings significant risk of failure But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a year we address his concern Depending on additional capability from Afghan rather than U S forces also addresses a major problem of public perception in Afghanistan The larger our own military footprint there the more our enemies can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a Muslim nation Finally we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders In Iraq large numbers of young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the Sons of Iraq They were drawn in part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating horrific violence in their own communities In their own interests and the interests of their nation they switched sides and became a positive force That same prospect exists in Afghanistan Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal They believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government s side could succeed if they are offered security for themselves and their families and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re integration to accomplish the same result as was achieved in Iraq Here is what General McChrystal said on th Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans some with foreign cadre with them But most we don t see are deeply ideological or even politically motivated most are operating for pay some are under a commander s charismatic leadership some are frustrated with local leaders So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call mid and low level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re integration Afghanistan under the constitution But this game changing possibility was apparently not factored General McChrystal s assessment There is no plan yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort They alone can accomplish this crucial job but first we and our Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken account as we consider the need for any additional U S military resources Afghanistan s people are grateful for our aid but also eager to assume responsibility for their future In a tiny village in Helmand Province we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting their shura One hundred or so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country s future When asked how long the United States should stay one elder said Until the moment that you make our security forces self sufficient Then you will be welcome to visit us not as soldiers but as guests Helping Afghanistan achieve self sufficiency in their security is everybody s goal On that there is little difference of opinion in Afghanistan s village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol Can we help Afghanistan reach self sufficiency in security fast enough Can we get there in a way that regains the initiative and creates the momentum we need Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don t share I believe we can by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police by providing more trainers more quickly by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq and by rapidly adopting a plan for the re integration of lower level Taliban fighters Afghan society In other words we need a surge of Afghan security forces Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security interest without creating a bigger U S military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis while completing the previously planned and announced increase in U S combat forces provides the best chance of success for our mission preventing Afghanistan from again being run by a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al Qaeda whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on the United States and the world And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U S ground combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year

2611,NI,Here s the update pieced together from various sources Starting at around pm Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene Foster The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review The discussion continued until around am when the parties left Hillsborough Foster s presence is apparently very helpful Her relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct treating them as equal colleagues Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks are The talks last night early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push on today to see if agreement can be reached It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP SF will decide to wind up today and resume on Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon The issue is still parades Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades It is important for him politically within the DUP but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too much Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades adding that Robinson has also moved The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson s goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal Dodds Logistically such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework requires consultation legislation and implementation The role of Justice Minister and his her relationship to the Executive has been agreed Other issues such as Irish language act N S bodies etc while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with

2657,"To rebuild Haiti, start with its young people",To rebuild Haiti start with its young people A strong national civic service corps would harness untapped labor rapidly and instill national pride and confidence By Muggah and Maguire Haiti will need big ideas to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude earthquake this month The reported death toll has topped and the reconstruction needs are incalculable How about starting with a strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth There are many reasons why such an entity makes a lot of sense Haiti is a young country An estimated of the population is under the to segment alone makes up of the population Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopment and accentuate political instability Although Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere Haitian youth are a wellspring of creativity talent and potential You don t need to be a community development specialist to know that they are stifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities Fortunately Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps Article of the Haitian Constitution commits citizens to national service though it has never been activated What is more there are many Haitian and international organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port au Prince and work They could start with the once iconic center of the capital but also could begin planting trees working the fields and providing services in Haiti s countryside At a minimum this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly Before the Jan earthquake of youth in their s were out of work Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring their and their country s pride and dignity A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the next crisis Hundreds of humanitarian agencies donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facing monumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance Although everyone involved is committed to rapid disbursement transaction costs are monumental A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferring capital Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from the bottom up Rather than food for work schemes international best practice recommends proposals that promote direct monetary transfers to beneficiaries Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don t need paternalistic programs that curb their choices With proper oversight and financial safeguards a civic service corps would circumvent unnecessary administrative costs Further a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions During past decades the state provided relatively few services to Haitians particularly outside the capital In some cases state entities were downright predatory As a result nonstate providers including gangs and shady middlemen filled the gap A civic service corps wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating the government s presence on the ground would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens It would be a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people A civic service corps also makes sense for long term risk and emergency planning Haiti is situated in the path of hurricanes and on a fault line and can expect more disasters Training young people especially young women in the basics of first aid emergency response community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate the consequences of future calamities With disciplined training and management the corps could provide more intensive training in specialized areas engineering telecommunications and public health An initial step to getting Haiti s youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haiti including the U N donor conference scheduled for Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluable experiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmental organization Viva Rio and its supporters Before the earthquake Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited and trained hundreds of Haitian youth including former gang members to provide relief services in Haiti s slums This program could be reactivated and scaled up quickly A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for say up to two years The Haitian government would of course need to be the one to manage the undertaking with direct oversight from the president s office and the Interior Ministry And there are many countries that could provide advice and support Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essential skills Haiti s youth are the future of the nation and they are central to Haiti s recovery A civic service corps is a large scale way to quickly mobilize them to act as catalyst for long term progressive changes Muggah based at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva is a principal of the SecDev Group and is currently advising multilateral and bilateral organizations on Haiti s recovery Maguire is on the faculty of Trinity Washington University and chairs the Haiti Working Group of the United States Institute of Peace in Washington Copyright c The Los Angeles Times

2760,FW: Joseph Nye/The New Public Diplomacy,Thought you might be interested in this piece by Joe Nye which I believe validates the new approach we are trying to implement We have begun to roll out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive We have organized a set of working groups around key initiatives women s empowerment cve expanded English language training cultural programming youth climate change etc so that we can incorporate new proposals FY budget and re direct FY and funds wherever possible and appropriate The working groups are being chaired by senior level officers from the regional bureaus Bob Craig Kelly etc and are being asked to report back within to weeks I ll continue to keep you posted as things move forward The New Public Diplomacy Joseph S Nye CAMBRIDGE The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would win In today s information age politics is also about whose story wins National narratives are indeed a type of currency Governments compete with each other and with other organizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents Witness the contest between the government and protesters after the Iranian elections in in which the Internet and Twitter played crucial roles or the recent controversy between Google and China Reputation has always mattered in world politics but credibility has become crucial because of a paradox of plenty When information is plentiful the scarce resource is attention Under the new conditions a soft sell may more than ever prove more effective than a hard sell For example the relative independence of the BBC sometimes a source of consternation to British governments has paid rich dividends in credibility as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete s day he rises at dawn listens to the BBC World Service then scans the Tanzanian press Skeptics who treat the term public diplomacy as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point Simple propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy Nor is public diplomacy merely a public relations campaign Public diplomacy also involves building long term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies The contribution of direct government information to long term cultural relationships varies with three dimensions or stages of public diplomacy and all three are important The first and most immediate dimension is daily communications which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign policy decisions This dimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises If there is a vacuum in information after an event others will rush in to fill it The second dimension is strategic communication which develops a set of simple themes much as a political or advertising campaign does While the first dimension is measured in hours and days the second occurs over weeks months and even years The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years or even decades through scholarships exchanges training seminars conferences and access to media channels These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R Murrow once called the crucial last three feet face to face communications with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product A communications strategy cannot work if it cuts against the grain of policy Actions speak louder than words All too often policymakers treat public diplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments For example China tried to enhance its soft power by successfully staging the Olympics but its domestic simultaneous crackdown in Tibet and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers undercut its gains Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage but they do not always understand how to do it Critics in the United States complain that the over militarization of foreign policy undercuts its credibility Instead they advocate diplomacy on steroids staffed by diplomats trained in new media cross cultural communications granular local knowledge and networks of contacts with under represented groups The centralized mass media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role Governments need to correct daily misrepresentations of their policies as well as to try to convey a longer term strategic message The main strength of the mass media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different cultural settings The sender knows what she says but not always what the targets hear Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard Networked communications on the other hand can take advantage of two way communications and peer to peer relations to overcome cultural differences This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for governments to accomplish given their central accountability structures The greater flexibility of non governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call the new public diplomacy which is no longer confined to messaging promotion campaigns or even direct governmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign policy purposes It is also about building relationships with civil society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non governmental parties at home and abroad In this approach to public diplomacy government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in rather than controlling such cross border networks Indeed too much government control or even the appearance of it can undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender The evolution of public diplomacy from one way communications to a two way dialogue treats publics as co creators of meaning and communication Power in a global information age more than ever will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard dimensions of coercion and payment Combining these dimensions effectively is called smart power For example the current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds and over reliance on hard power alone is not the path to success Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power but smart public diplomacy requires an understanding of credibility self criticism and the role of civil society in generating soft power If it degenerates propaganda public diplomacy not only fails to convince but can undercut soft power Instead it must remain a two way process because soft power depends first and foremost upon understanding the minds of others

like this visit the Sunt sgPt Fooriciatico s clog More than a million spectators gathered before the Capitol on a frosty afternoon to witness the inauguration of Barad Obama who promised in his campaign to change Washington s mercenary culture of lobbyists special interest influence and backroom deals But within a few months of being sworn in the President and his top aides were sitting down with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care reform possible Over the following months pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of times to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration s health care reform agenda in exchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president s promises to reform the pharmaceutical industry They flooded Congress with campaign contributions and hired dozens of former Capitol insiders to push their case How they did it pieced together from news accounts disclosure forms including lobbying reports and Federal Election Commission records White House visitor logs and the sghedu S in Max Baucus releases yoiun tarily is a testament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington In the campaign Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation s health care system but also supported key qemocr atic health reform uok sies Among these were several that targeted the pharmaceutical industry Allowing re importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and providing Medicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program These weren t just promises Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in Rdl Call Vote and Roll call Vo t c Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol veterans schooled in the monied Washington culture chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina Emanuel was a former fundraiser Clinton administration official investment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress Messina was the former campaign manager B and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus Both were known for their unparalleled legislative abilities Because of Obama s decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process members of Congress also played key roles Early on the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Bpuf s Baucus would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and PhRMA Central to this effort was PhRMA president CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin a longtime Democratic member of Congress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in By switching parties Tauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy Commerce Tauzin became the poster child of Washington s mercenary culture He crafted a bill to provide prescription drug access to Medicare recipients one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry Medicare would not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not be allowed A few months after the bill passed Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and would be taking a job helming PhRMA for a salary of million Tauzin s job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of simply titled Biliy It featured the candidate sleeves rolled up talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the ways of Washington The pharmaceutical industry wrote the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with drug companies And you know what the chairman of the committee who pushed the law through went to work for the pharmaceutical industry making million a year The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that Barack Obama is the only candidate who refuses Washington lobbyist money while the candidate continues his lecture Imagine that That s an example of the same old game playing in Washington You know I don t want to learn how to play the game better I want to put an end to the game playing Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities Over the course of the drug industry trade group sdeft tow i tniliion on in house and hired lobbyists Aside from PhRMA s massive in house lobbying operation the trade group hired outside lobbying firms The total number of lobbyists working for PhRMA in reached Some of those lobbyists representing PhRMA were former employees of either the legislative or executive branches Of these dozens were former congressional staffers including two former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics drug makers coptr ibu ed sums to ongressional ecii om lttee s during the same period from to the end of thquarter numbers are still being totaled industry political action committees employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over million Those contributions tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a to percent margin the first time in any election cycle going back to the first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving that Democrats were so favored Given their majorities on Capitol and the new President s intention to reform America s health care system the new tilt was perhaps not surprising On the White House a Tee tiilfa ivitfi rnnic r nealth care induLd er s to try to bring them to the table and see what could be done to gain their support In attendance were Billy Tauzin president CEO and top lobbyist for PhRMA Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler America s Health Care Plans AHIP Chairman Karen lgnani Tom Donohue of the Chamber of Commerce and Wood Johnson Foundations Rise Lavizzomourey A day before the White House meeting Tauzin a f Ci IF lc touting health care reform and promising to work closely with the Obama administration In the interview he touted it as an optimistic plan acknowledging that the industry did have a few problems but was glad to have a chance to discuss these Spme were duri rognnd td by this apparent change of heart on of an industry long adverse to health care reforms On Jim Messina and Jon Selib chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus convened a meeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee DSCC with leaders of organized labor and health care groups including PhRMA At the meeting the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote reform efforts Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care that would be almost entftelv funoed pj PhRMA The two groups spent million on their advertising campaigns the contract to produce and place ads went to White House Senior Advisor AKPD which owed million In the next month CEO s from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least four times These talks preceded a major public event at the White House one critical to its strategy to promote health care reform On PhRMA and other trade industry groups piedaed cost v itting measures to the White House that would save they claimed upwards of trillion over the next decade President Obama announced the deal in the State Dining Room flanked by leaders of the various trade groups the administration followed up with a media blitz in the press and on the White House Web site The next day Healthy Economy Now s PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement in support of the health care reform process calling for the government to finally fix the nation s health care cost problems While many elements of the trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they could ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed door meetings with the White House The first occurred on White House visitor logs show PhRMA s top executives including Tauzin and industry CEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform On the same day the publicly available schedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee chairman What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on In a press release featuring a statement by Tauzin Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill According to news re gorts Baucus initially proposed billion in cost cutting measures but the executives and lobbyists meeting on were able to win the lower figure The terms of the initial cost cutting deal included billion go directly towards closing the donut hole in Medicare prescription drug coverage The donut hole is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare prescription drug coverage For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at spent and does not pick back up again until is spent by the participant The amount proposed in the deal percent coverage for drugs within the coverage gap however would not completely close the donut hole In Baucus press release Tauzin is quoted as saying This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and working together we can make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today This once in a lifetime opportunity also extended to the pharmaceutical industry s ability to blunt the long term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through Medicare negotiations re importation and quicker release of generics onto the market After making such a grand statement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the White House and Democrats to take certain chips off the table Baucus proceeded with a pia n c c r ivene a bicartisap rimuo in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley Mike Enzi and Olympia Snowe Baucus decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry which were reliant on Baucus producing a bill slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to meet the White House s announced iltuouet reces dee rie for passing health care reform Soon after PhRMA s big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on and this time met with Rehm Emanuel and Jim Messina Baucus chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this meeting In The Huffirytorj Dosi Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that outlined the policies that would not be allowed any final version of health care reform These included Medicare prescription drug negotiations drug re importation and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D and Part B The deal would be billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more While the billion deal was cut with Baucus committee other congressional committees continued to mark up their own versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the final product In the House of Representatives the House Energy Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the billion deal Energy Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gotten the White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill These included drug reimportation Medicare negotiating power and speedier release of generics to the market According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by the committee these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts far exceeding the billion cap agreed to by the White House Baucus and PhRMA The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA which included all of the CEOs involved in the deal cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus The board pressured Tauzin to go public with the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege On the Los Ancg les Firrief in an exclusive report featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and that as Tauzin put it The White House blessed it Tom Hamburger wrote in the article For his part Tauzin said he had not only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining but also a separate promise not to pursue another proposal Obama supported during the campaign importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe The White House s Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin s claim stating The president encouraged this approach He wanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform Democratic lawmakers were furious Rep Raul Grijaiva chairman of the Progressive Caucus asked Are industry groups going to be the ones at the table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust On Baucus bill made a private circulation on the pharmaceutical industry cost cutting did not exceed billion Five days later the New York limes reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to million in an advertising blitz in support of Baucus bill The Times noted that the ad spending would be a follow up to the deal that drug makers struck in with Mr Baucus and the White House On Baucus released the full text of his les j islation to the public t The White House PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact The key amendment targeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark up came from Sen Bill Nelson from Florida which has one of the largest Medicare participant populations in the nation The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson a position to push for further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing His target closing the donut hole completely Nelson claimed that his amendment would onerate billion in revenue or from PhRMA s perspective increase their cost cutting to billion That would be unacceptable to PhRMA to Baucus to the White House and to the pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal Other Senate Democrats Tom Carper and Menendez voted with Republicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment It is little surprise the Carper s Delaware is home to AstraZeneca and Menendez New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb all of which lobbied for the billion cap Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill with the cap in place on Debate began on Dec and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal Senator Byron Dorgan introduced an amendment that would allow for drug re importation but as the date for voting drew near the Federal Drug Administration FDA released a letter objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points as currently written the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive In addition there are significant safety concerns Dorgan s amendment was defeated with numerous Democrats previously in support of reimportation switching to no votes On Christmas Eve the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact New Year s Eve passed with no further action on health care reform Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill had been slipping throughout It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts on Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the senator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill Democrats ran for cover Despite having the largest majorities of any party since the s Democrats put the brakes on their agenda particularly health care reform in the end the pharmaceutical industry s support for health care reform would be left up in the air After spending million in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the pharmaceutical industry the legislative process had flat lined In the board of PhRMA split over the deal cut by Tauzin pushedjauzin to res i s his post In an interview with Diane Sawvqf President Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform The health care debate as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents but also amongst supporters that we just don t know what s going on And it s an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of back room deals

2834,"H: couple of things pre-Shaun: bomb in NI and latest UK poll, Labour moving. Sid",Car bomb explodes in Northern Ireland Republican dissidents suspected after blast outside courthouse in Newry as evacuation was taking place Buzz up Diqg it Mark Tran quardian co uk Article history A car bomb exploded last night outside the courthouse in Newry Northern Ireland police said There were no initial reports of any injuries in the blast Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm Officers were in the process of evacuating the area when the car exploded Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process The incident comes only days after a mortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry Gary McKeown condemned those responsible Lives could have been lost as a result of this bombing he said It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community or the cause of a united Ireland If people want to advance their beliefs they should enter the democratic process and debate with their political opponents rather than resorting to violence Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing Earlier this month police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll the first PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province The Continuity IRA shot the year old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon County Armagh on last year His murder came just hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in Antrim In police discovered a massive lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill On Republican Sinn Fein political allies of the Continuity IRA claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out surveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan Co Armagh in recent weeks They claimed the men were scouting the areas in white civilian vans Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Reconnaissance Regiment The alleged presence of SRR soldiers formerly known as the th Intelligence Unit is controversial because British troops are meant to have been pulled off the streets especially in nationalist areas Britain heading for hung parliament Guardian ICM poll Tories might not win election outright suggests new survey Comments Buzz up Digq it Julian Glover quardian co uk GMT Article history The Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright according to a Guardian ICM poll published today The new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for Cameron s party The opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues including the economy and in particular may be losing their campaign against Labour s so called death tax Labour leads the Tories by eight points as the party with the best policy on care for the elderly The two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis against a nine point Tory lead when the question was last asked in With no more than three months to go until polling day the Conservatives have fallen to down three on last month s Guardian ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month The party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis last falling to in As recently as last the Tories hit in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that the race is tightening which confirms the findings of some other recent polls Meanwhile Labour s support at is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last and slightly above its average for the second part of last year However there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Brown s Piers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekend s reports about Brown bullying his staff Labour s support is up one point on the last Guardian ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll Research began last and most was carried out before the serialisation of Rawnsley s book in yesterday s Observer which may have affected Labour support Around a fifth of responses were collected on Nick Clegg s hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by today s poll which puts the Liberal Democrats on unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last month s Guardian poll All this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smaller parties which are on a total of Nationalists are on Ukip and the Greens on each and the BNP on Estimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary but a lead is at the margins of what the Tories think they need to win a majority One academic calculation suggests the result would leave Labour only seats behind the Tories in a hung parliament although any improved Tory performance in marginal seats would offset that CMResearch interviewed a random sample of adults by telephone on Interviews were conducted across the country

2835,Bravo! Brava! Issue your statement! Sid,Northern Ireland agrees power sharing deal Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from Henry McDonald quardian co uk GMT Brown the DUP leader Peter Robinson and Sinn Fein s Martin McGuinness I to r talk to the press after the Northern Ireland power sharing deal was announced Photograph Julien Behal PA Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland s power sharing government from in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that opens a new chapter after decades of violence Brown said today Standing alongside his Irish counterpart Brian Cowen at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast the prime minister said the inspirational agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party DUP was a foundation for lasting peace The deal finally agreed to by the DUP last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace comes after two weeks of round the clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power sharing government might collapse It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans on overseeing parades Brown who travelled to Belfast this morning said the agreement had been possible because of a new spirit of mutual co operation and respect The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power sharing executive In return the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland including the abolition of the Parades Commission a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists A cross community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on before the policing and justice powers are devolved from London on Brown told reporters The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational This moment and this agreement belongs to the people of Northern Ireland all of the people and now more than ever before so does their future This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence years of talks weeks of stalemate Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making fair and balanced compromises to bridge the divisions and said the quality of the negotiations meant that the devolved institutions can and will work The Northern Ireland secretary Shaun Woodward said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last days The deal would absolutely make Northern Ireland a safer place he said The DUP leader Peter Robinson said the agreement will be more enduring because of the time spent in forming it Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of when negotiations bore fruit at the th hour the Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams described the current deal and the rescue of power sharing as yet another very good Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP s strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal But the Ulster Unionist party UUP has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up legislation to change the way parades are judged A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two governments We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it she said The talks which centred on Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in the near year peace process Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power sharing government led by the two parties The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont s parliament building Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the proposals Earlier in the week up to DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give unionists enough concessions Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it the deal to our party to the other parties in Northern Ireland and to the community An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party s manifesto is the requirement for community confidence we believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice TUV Jim Allister questioned why the DUP rebels had changed their minds The deal hasn t changed only the snowmen of the DUP who melted once the heat came on Allister said The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election Allister will portray the deal as a sell out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism

Sid,http www guardian co uk politics feb northern ireland police powers agreement Brown hails new chapter in Northern Ireland as end to years of violence Promise of US investment follows momentous agreement that seals power sharing framework Henry McDonald Ireland correspondent quardian co uk GMT X British and Irish PMs endorse power sharing deal Link to this video Northern Ireland s leaders have been rewarded with the promise of a new US investment programme after securing a historic deal today which saved power sharing Brown and his Irish counterpart Brian Cowen flew Northern Ireland to put their seal of approval on the deal which will create a Department of Justice gives unionists concessions on the issue of Protestant parades and saves the power sharing executive from collapse Brown said the achievements over the longest period of unbroken negotiations since the peace process began years ago were inspirational This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence years of talks weeks of stalemate Tonight the White House said Barack Obama saw the deal as an important step to greater peace and prosperity for all communities on the island Obama would also meet Cowen the DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson and the deputy first minister Sinn Fein s Martin McGuinness in Washington on St Patrick s Day next month Earlier Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state said the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein was a shining example to other parts of the world locked in religious and ethnic conflicts As a result of the deal she said The people of Northern Ireland are poised to build a thriving society on this stronger foundation Our economic envoy DecIan Kelly will continue to help Northern Ireland reap the dividends of peace including economic growth international investment and new opportunities In the near future Declan and I will host first minister Robinson and deputy first minister McGuinness in Washington The Irish prime minister said the agreement reached presents a real opportunity to renew the partnership which is the life blood of the devolved institutions The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangible outcomes that improve their lives Referring back to the Belfast agreement of Gerry Adams the Sinn Fein president described today s agreement as yet another good After reaching an agreement just before midnight on the parties in the Northern Ireland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place They will vote on to devolve policing and justice powers which will then create a justice ministry on a key Sinn Fein demand throughout these negotiations Under the agreement a six member working group appointed by Robinson and McGuinness will formulate a framework for handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission The new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems with the rights of marchers and residents taken account It will complete its work within three weeks when the Northern Ireland executive will transfer responsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the group s proposals An executive working group will be set up in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists to improve the way the power sharing cabinet is run Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the St Andrews agreement that led to the DUP Sinn Fein deals These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish language speakers Ian Paisley Jr the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUP s founder described the agreement as a win for unionism Paisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission which most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists He added that unionist critics of the deal had no alternative except the imposition of joint authority from London and Dublin Mindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice Robinson said There are some who will play politics with this agreement but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormont that our whole community identifies with and supports Jim Allister the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP said he was relishing the prospect of a general election contest with his former party Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Sr s North Antrim constituency In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein They get their date for policing and justice Secondly their veto can be exercised over the justice ministry They now have working party on Irish language North South bodies are strengthened And finally there is a stronger north south parliamentary forum The DUP only get a view of parading issues Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post he said Shaun Woodward the Northern Ireland secretary said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined to destabilise the power sharing government He said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now two groups of people who were once terrible rivals who have found a way through a very big challenge But the Real IRA Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the accord at Hillsborough In the past seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations across Northern Ireland Republican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policing and justice powers are transferred to Belfast

2878,FW: Confirmations Update,FYI Reid Shelby Has Hold On All Nominees Feb Sen Shelby R Ala has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effort to win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state according to aides to Senate Majority Leader Reid Reid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than pending nominations Reid can force a vote on any nomination by filing cloture Because of the time required to vote on multiple nominations the Senate processes most nominations by unanimous consent Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up The nominations will remain stalled unless Reid files cloture While holds are frequent Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than is normal He should not be holding up plus nominees for a parochial issue a Democratic aide said They re qualified and they should be moving forward Disclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with Republican holds on executive nominees We ve got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified nobody has a specific objection to them but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business President Obama said in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats On the Senate floor Reid Senate Majority Whip Durbin Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped Republicans for holds on national security nominees and judges Reid who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President W Bush from making recess appointments said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments which the president can make when the Senate is out of session What alternatives do we have Reid said on the floor What alternative do we have Earlier in the day a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on several pending nominees due to unaddressed national security concerns including frustrations with the Air Force s handling of the competition for an aerial refueling tanker The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold Northrop Grumman Corp and EADS the European consortium behind Airbus and Boeing Co are vying for the high stakes contract potentially worth billion The Northrop EADS team would build the planes in Mobile Ala but has threatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals Nearly years after the U S Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet we still do not have a transparent and fair acquisition process to move forward the spokesman said The Department of Defense must recognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed Defense Secretary Gates told House lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposals soon and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition Obviously we would like to have a competition for it and we hope that both companies will agree to participate but we will move forward Gates said We have to have new tankers In addition to the tanker issue Shelby s spokesman said he is frustrated that the Obama administration won t build an Alabama based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices Shelby secured a million earmark in the FY omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center to be set up at the Army s Redstone Arsenal Sen Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensic and technical exploitation related to IEDs but this administration s coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort the spokesman said He has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time Also Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by Republican foot dragging that he was considering whether Senate rules should be changed There s a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a supermajority on almost everything Biden said moments after swearing in Sen Scott Brown R Mass who gives Republicans votes enough to filibuster on any issue What I have been doing is spending a lot of time having my staff go back and scrub this you know the use of the filibuster and how it s worked Biden said This is not a constitutional requirement Biden defended the vote requirement calling it a useful tool It s legitimate but from my perspective having served here having been elected seven times I ve never seen a time when it s become sort of standard operating procedure Requiring a supermajority is just not a good way to do business by Dan Friedman and Scully

2883,fyi: latest on candidacy. Sid,EU leaders to debate presidency on summit sidelines Climate talks overshadowed by divisive subject of Tony s candidacy to be Europe s first president European government chiefs gather in Brussels this evening for a summit likely to be the first occasion to broach the divisive subject of Tony s candidacy to be Europe s first president The topic is not formally on the agenda of a meeting that will be dominated by wrangling over climate change funding and how to get the Czech president Vaclav Klaus to add the final signature to the reformist Lisbon treaty But senior diplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question who will get the plum job of first sitting president of the European council the pre eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for summits at least four times a year Miliband the foreign secretary said today that would give Europe a strong voice on the global stage but his comments were seized on by his Conservative shadow Hague who said the debate over the presidency proved that the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty Officially the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty expected within weeks While personally has kept quiet about his ambitions the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the former prime minister s We will be making the case for a strong internationally known figure who can open doors in foreign capitals said an official There is only one candidate That was not a reference to Jean Claude Juncker the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer who is the only contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy He emerged this week as the anti Juncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job But he may well succeed in destroying s chances being viewed as a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender While the debate rages on the sidelines of the summit the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the meeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the Copenhagen conference in Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim Fredrik Reinfeldt the Swedish prime minister warned that Europe s credibility on global warming was at stake In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach agreement The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to bn bn a year by for transfers to the developing countries to combat global warming The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal But with the other big players especially the US which is reluctant to commit to a figure Germany believes Europe should not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations The European commission and others such as the UK and the Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe s global leadership role on climate change and send a strong signal to other potential signatories The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil which is wealthier than the poorer EU members The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen unless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU s governments In the midst of a financial crisis the eastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund Angela Merkel sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor will be pivotal to any climate change financing deal and her answer to the question may also be decisive So far she has been hedging her bets While Nicolas Sarkozy the French president is known to support with reservations there are no German candidates for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon the European president and a European foreign minister or high representative for foreign and security policy In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts although there was little information on whether they reached a pact Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on almost everything Austria Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post themselves have come out publicly against on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU member states out of the total Adding his voice to the argument Demitris Christofias the president of Cyprus said a council president from a small country would be more objective and more consensual The European Union is a family of compromises The Dutch centre right prime minister and possible contender Jan Peter Balkenende has come under pressure this week to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his government Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than focusing on who gets what under Lisbon Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names If Klaus signs thetreaty soon a special summit would be convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister also leaving the European commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso to put together a new team

2929,"Anecdotal, attitudinal, but maybe helpful. Sid",http www timesonline co uk tol comment columnists guest contributors article ece From The Times Fear of the poor is hampering Haiti rescue American views rule among the rubble of Port au Prince That s one reason aid is taking so long to get to those in need Linda Polman Aid workers have already baptised the earthquake in Haiti a historical disaster It will rate high in the annals of the humanitarian aid world because of the number of victims and scale of the destruction But the rescue operation is also becoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims Five days after the quake hit many places are still largely bereft of international aid Not through lack of funds supplies or emergency experts Those are all pouring in from dozens of countries But most of the aid and aid workers seems stuck at the airport Rescue teams have pulled survivors from five star hotels university buildings a supermarket and the UN headquarters all in Port au Prince s better neighbourhoods In poor areas where the damage appears much greater apparently forgotten victims report on Twitter that they have yet to encounter the first foreign rescuer Many aid workers are reported to have orders not to venture out without armed guards which are not there at all or only after long debates with the UN military command The UN has lost a number of staff in the quake and is not keen to risk more lives But the Haitian people seem to scare aid workers more than Somali warlords Darfuri Janjawid or Afghan Taleban Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned a mission without reaching the collapsed building where people were trapped and frightened doctors have left their patients unattended The experience of CNN s medical reporter Dr Sanjay Gupta is telling In a makeshift clinic he encountered a Belgian medical team being evacuated in a UN bus UN rules of engagement apparently stopped them providing security for the doctors The Belgians took most of their medical supplies with them to keep them out of the claws of robbers Dr Gupta and his camera team stayed the night monitored the abandoned patients vital signs and continued intravenous drips and they were not robbed Some rescuers are leaning so much toward security that they will allow people to die The media are not helping CNN rules in the rubble Outside of a military conflict this is our biggest international deployment since the tsunami in according to Tony Maddox the managing director of CNN International So the image of the aid operation being beamed back is primarily Ameridan and one of the big problems is the American view of Haiti CNN won t stop telling aid workers and the outside world about pillaging the incidence of which for the first four frustrating days at least did not compare with what happened after Hurricane Katrina and about how dangerous it is to distribute food because of the likelihood of stampedes Nor is the US Government the biggest player in the aid operation doing anything to help to relax the atmosphere On the contrary When President Obama said that the US aid effort would be aggressive he meant it The humanitarian operation is not led by civilian agencies but by the Pentagon Mr Obama ordered troops and a fleet of nuclear powered ships to move in Victims of the war in Congo which has cost five million lives in the past years and of the genocide in Darfur would love so much American attention but it is Haiti s fate to lay in America s backyard and to have been a sore to American eyes for decades already One perhaps even two million Haitians already live in the United States but more try to come Every day dead Haitian refugees wash up on Miami s sunny beaches Haiti is a constant pain for US taxpayers who feel that the billions of dollars that have been poured in should have at least lifted the country out of its position as one of the poorest places on Earth Even when the earthquake struck investigations were taking place the fate of several million dollars of aid funds sent to victims of a hurricane that hit Haiti in that have disappeared Furthermore to the horror of many godfearing Americans voodoo is an officially recognised religion in Haiti And perhaps above all Haitians are poor and black In the view of some Americans those two add up to murderous gangs The invasion of soldiers and humanitarian workers at the airport of Port au Prince reminds me of the American military invasion of Haiti authorised by President Clinton in I d lived and worked there for almost two years as a correspondent for Dutch radio There were soldiers but they were surprisingly nervous about what reception the unarmed Haitians might have in store for them It turned out to be a wave of slum dwellers streaming to the air and sea port to greet the American guests In abundant conga lines they snaked through the city tea cosies on their heads to express just how happy they were Liberte Merci Beel Cling Dong they shouted A terrified American GI still a teenager saw the mass of pitiful creatures approaching him and asked me if the tea cosies were some kinda voodoo He calmed down only when a line of BMWs and Mitsubishis appeared and filed past to watch the invasion Where the soldier came from the owners of vehicles like these are respectable citizens In Haiti they are likely to be the ones smuggling drugs and making US aid dollars disappear The good guys in Haiti are the defenceless people in the slums For Western city dwellers this is the world turned upside down Back Back the soldier shouted aiming his weapons at the good guys The rescue teams that stay put at the airport are one reason why we still don t really know what is going on Seventy survivors had been pulled from the rubble so far the International Red Cross said on That s rescues per day as a joint result of the international specialised rescue workers that are there That number would surely jump if some of the professional equipment that they brought was made available to the countless groups of local people desperately digging for victims with their bare hands day and night Let s hope that the food distributors worrying about their safety know that yesterday hundreds of people in Port au Prince dropped to their knees praying outside a warehouse where workers for the agency Food for the Poor had announced that they would be distributing rice and beans The crowd allowed children and the elderly to go first in line without having guns aimed at them first Linda Polman s War Games The Story of War and Aid in Modern Times will be

2960,H: Bingo. Sid,oplose Window I TA Print this page From The Times Brown on course to win election and Jonathan Oliver GORDON BROWN is on course to remain prime minister after the general election as a new Times poll reveals that Labour is now just two points behind the Tories The YouGov survey places Cameron s Conservatives on as against for Labour the closest gap between the parties in more than two years It means Labour is heading for a total of seats nine short of an overall majority with the Tories languishing on a total of just MPs Such an outcome would mean Brown could stay in office and deny Cameron the keys to No The poll result presents the Conservative leader with one of the greatest challenges of his leadership today as he makes the keynote speech to his party s spring forum In an interview with The Times Cameron defied his right wing critics who believe the party s modernisation has gone too far He said Some people say to me Play things safe try to win by default the government is in a mess I say No This is the Conservative party that is offering radical change I m doubling up on change With the expected election now just over two months away Cameron will seek to reconnect with voters through a series of pledges including a plan to restore discipline in schools In an echo of the speech that won him the Tory leadership in he will address the Brighton conference without notes This is very very clear he said I ve made my choice There is no going back This election is about change and we will be offering change Cameron insisted he was unconcerned about the collapse in Tory support The polls move around a lot he said The voters tell us that they want change They want to know the Conservative party itself has changed The narrowing of the Conservative lead has been dramatic and rapid Until the Tories held close to a point lead But a week ago a Times YouGov poll put the gap at six points suggesting a hung parliament with the Tories still on course to become the largest party In the last election in support for the parties generally held steady in the run up to polling day YouGov polling for The Times showed Labour leads of between two and five points from through to the election Labour s margin of victory was three points In today s poll Labour has risen two points on the previous week from while the Conservatives have dropped two from The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on The collapse in the Tory poll lead will put pressure on the pound in financial markets tomorrow by adding to fears that a hung parliament will mean insufficient action is taken to cut Britain s budget deficit The last time the gap between the two main parties came this close and the Tory support was so low was in autumn That was before Brown s honeymoon ended with his failure to call a snap general election The Conservatives went on to peak in with a point lead Today s poll suggests recent claims about Brown s tantrums and his intimidation of staff may have actually helped him Just of people believe the prime minister is a bully and agree he has a strong sense of right and wrong The survey disclosed growing concerns about Cameron s elite background and lack of empathy with ordinary families Just think that Cameron understands problems faced by people like me compared with for Brown Furthermore only think the Conservative leader wants to do the best for all groups in Britain against for the prime minister Peter Kellner president of YouGov the Times pollster said that while individual polls could throw up unexpected shifts the recent trend had been for a significant narrowing of the Tory lead Our daily polls should be regarded a bit like the FTSE index a point rise or fall in a day might be a blip or a trend often we can t tell for a few days he said I am confident the Tory lead is down this weekend but I can t promise whether the latest movement will be sustained increased or reversed in the days ahead One of the reasons for doing daily polls is to monitor these fluctuations The Tory lead of which was first reported in The Times was maintained in YouGov s polls in The Sun last week The increase in support for Labour on and as the latest Times poll was being conducted came as figures showed a strengthening economic recovery Under the British parliamentary system the prime minister remains in office after a general election until he either tenders his resignation or is defeated in a Commons no confidence vote If the election result leaves Labour just short of an overall majority Brown is likely to battle on with Labour running the country as a minority government The party would seek to do deals with minor parties such as Ulster s Democratic Unionist party or if necessary Nick Clegg s Liberal Democrats to get its legislation through parliament If repeated in a general election on the basis of a uniform swing in all constituencies today s poll would leave Labour just nine seats short of the needed for an overall majority in the new seat House of Commons The Tories would be well behind on seats with the Liberal Democrats on Kellner calculated that even allowing for a larger swing to the Tories in marginal seats where the party has spent millions of pounds on campaigning the poll was consistent with Labour being by far the largest party He suggested that in such a scenario Labour might win seats with the Tories on and the Lib Dems on Labour will believe it is benefiting from the upturn in the economy For the first time in a YouGov poll since before the financial crisis people trust Labour more than the Tories to run the economy YouGov which began polling after the election has developed a reputation for accuracy Its final Times poll in was precisely right and it accurately

2999,GC,FYI Jan Mobile Home Top Stories Inside the Reid eruption By Mike Allen Glenn Thrush I AM EST Harry Reid isn t talkative But the Senate majority leader chatted freely with the two disarmingly charming book authors who came to his office at the Capitol shortly after the election They and their tape recorder were soaking in his reminiscences about the wild campaign that had turned a backbencher in his caucus president of the United States Reid wasn t on guard perhaps because he d been told by his staff that the meeting would be off the record according to a person with knowledge of the exchange Although Reid is a master of the Senate s mysterious inside game he s often botched the outside game because of what one colleague calls a penchant for saying things without a filter But Jim Manley Reid s senior communications adviser wasn t too worried as he and his boss sat down with Heilemann of New York Magazine and Mark Halperin of Time magazine two veteran reporters who were working on what their publisher had billed as a sweeping novelistic and ultimately definitive portrait of the race Like virtually every Washington political insider Manley had a long and warm relationship with Halperin the longtime political director for ABC News who once set conventional wisdom in Washington with The Note Maybe Reid and Manley thinking back to their many candid exchanges over the years simply assumed that Halperin wouldn t burn him or his boss Or maybe he expected that Halperin would check back with him on any quotes he planned to use Whatever they were thinking they were wrong Reid was talking about the reasons why even though he had publicly professed neutrality in the vicious Democratic primaries of he had secretly encouraged then Illinois Sen Barack Obama to challenge another member of his caucus then New York Sen Hillary Clinton And amid all the talk of Obama s oratorical gifts he let slip something else Obama could win the White House because he was a light skinned African American with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one The authors write in Game Change published this weekend that Reid had made the remark privately They did not say he had said it to them As a chagrined Reid telephoned political allies in the Senate and civil rights community to shore up his support this weekend he made it clear that he felt burned by the authors In the book s Authors Note they wrote All of our interviews from those with junior staffers to those with the candidates themselves were conducted on a deep background basis which means we agreed not to identify the subjects as sources in any way We believed this was essential to eliciting the level of candor on which a book of this sort depends Heilemann said on MSNBC s Morning Joe We had a very clear agreement with all those sources that our interviews would be on deep background Our ground rules are that we won t identify any of our sources as the sources of the material But we said to them all very clearly that if they put themselves in scenes of the book if they were uttering dialogue to people in the book in part of a scene that we would identify them as the utterer of those words Halperin added There s no one we talked to for the book who we burned in any way or violated any agreement with Manley a Capitol veteran who also had worked for the late Sen Ted Kennedy had been responsible for monitoring the interview and dealing with issues arising from it But he didn t tell anyone else in Reid s inner circle about the inflammatory remarks their boss had made because of his good relationship with the authors he assumed that the quotes would never be made public at least not without his knowing about it first Manley declined comment on this story and wouldn t confirm if the interview took place On at p m half a year after the interview The Atlantic s Marc Ambinder e mailed Reid s staff with questions about a light skinned candidate without a Negro dialect In the second guessing that followed Capitol veterans said there was no way that such inflammatory words from a Senate majority leader would remain off the record even if that had been the arrangement But because Manley had not sounded an internal alarm he and the rest of the damage control squad were caught flat footed by Ambinder s e mail several people close to the situation told POLITICO They could have had weeks to prepare for this or to try to convince Halperin not to run it said a Democrat who participated in some of the damage control Now the staff had been blindsided with a revelation that if mishandled could be politically fatal Manley and other aides worked until a m to draft Reid s carefully written apology which emphasized his record on African American issues I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words the word statement began Later on Manley helped lead a counteroffensive calling White House press secretary Gibbs a friend from his days as communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to set up an apology call between Reid at home in Searchlight Nev and Obama back in Washington In a stunning Statement by the President e mailed to reporters at p m Obama said Harry Reid called me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today As far as I m concerned the book is closed Relieved to have the president s solid backing Reid s aides decided that their toughest challenge would be to prevent any prominent African American Democrats from attacking Reid too harshly or calling for his resignation Reid s team correctly anticipated that Republicans would demand his head Keeping that criticism from becoming a bipartisan drumbeat was the key The team calculated that as long as the attacks looked like partisan shouting Reid would benefit Aides say their boss quickly understood the danger and spent much of working a call list of about prominent African Americans across the country On the calls he apologized for his words and argued that the book s main takeaway should be that he had quietly supported Obama over Clinton long before those made his feelings public Among those he called were the Rev Al Sharpton longtime civil rights leader Julian Bond Rep Barbara Lee D Calif chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus political consultant and talk show fixture Donna Brazile House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn D S C Wade Henderson CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Hilary Shelton director of the NAACP s Washington office The extent of the damage to his already shaky reelection chances in Nevada won t be known until But by Reid believed the Washington storm was passing From his home in New York Sen Chuck Schumer telephoned Reid in Nevada and offered to organize a letter of support from all the Democratic senators Reid decided that was unnecessary He had confidently concluded that for now at least he had won the inside game

Sid",Op Ed Columnist Taking On China By PAUL KRUGMAN Tensions are rising over Chinese economic policy and rightly so China s policy of keeping its currency the renminbi undervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery Something must be done To give you a sense of the problem Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency selling renminbi and buying foreign currencies so as to keep the renminbi weak and China s exports artificially competitive began around At that point China was adding about billion a month to its reserves and in it ran an overall surplus on its current account a broad measure of the trade balance of billion Today China is adding more than billion a month to its trillion hoard of reserves The International Monetary Fund expects China to have a current surplus of more than billion times the figure This is the most distortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed And it s a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world Most of the world s large economies are stuck in a liquidity trap deeply depressed but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are already near zero China by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus is in effect imposing an anti stimulus on these economies which they can t offset So how should we respond First of all the U S Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating Twice a year by law Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade The law s intent is clear the report should be a factual determination not a policy statement In practice however Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling to do what the law requires namely explain to Congress why it isn t taking action Instead it has spent the past six or seven years pretending not to see the obvious Will the next report due continue this tradition Stay tuned If Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation then what Here we have to get past a common misunderstanding the view that the Chinese have us over a barrel because we don t dare provoke China dumping its dollar assets What you have to ask is What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U S assets Would interest rates soar Short term U S interest rates wouldn t change they re being kept near zero by the Fed which won t raise rates until the unemployment rate comes down Long term rates might rise slightly but they re mainly determined by market expectations of future short term rates Also the Fed could offset any interest rate impact of a Chinese pullback by expanding its own purchases of long term bonds It s true that if China dumped its U S assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies such as the euro But that would be a good thing for the United States since it would make our goods more competitive and reduce our trade deficit On the other hand it would be a bad thing for China which would suffer large losses on its dollar holdings In short right now America has China over a barrel not the other way around So we have no reason to fear China But what should we do Some still argue that we must reason gently with China not confront it But we ve been reasoning with China for years as its surplus ballooned and gotten nowhere on Wen Jiabao the Chinese prime minister declared absurdly that his nation s currency is not undervalued The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the renminbi is undervalued by between and percent And Mr Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually does seeking to weaken their currencies just for the purposes of increasing their own exports But if sweet reason won t work what s the alternative In the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe problem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary percent surcharge on imports which was removed a few months later after Germany Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies At this point it s hard to see China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action except that this time the surcharge would have to be much larger say percent I don t propose this turn to policy hardball lightly But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world s economic problems at a time when those problems are already very severe It s time to take a stand Home World U S N Y Region Business Technology Science Health Sports Opinion Arts Style Travel Jobs Real Estate Automobiles Back to Top Copyright The New York Times Company Privacy Policy Terms of Service Search Corrections RSS First Look Help Contact Us Work for Us Site Map

mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over the last year Though Oben la s insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate he went a step too far by including building in East Jerusalem Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem no government let alone one headed by the Likud could possibly agree to a freeze there Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met The result was that Palestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly Obama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations Though Palestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank they now refused to sit down with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building Obama s demand for a building freeze in Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations Finally after intensive efforts the administration produced the pathetic achievement of proximity talks setting Palestinian Israeli negotiations back a generation to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same table with Israelis That Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was after ail an amateur But he has now taken his failed policy and intensified it By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo and elsewhere in East Jerusalem and placing that demand at the center of American Israeli relations he s ensured that the Palestinians won t show up even to proximity talks This is no longer amateurishness it is pique disguised as policy Initially when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made Israelis shared Vice President Biden s humiliation and were outraged at their government s incompetence The widespread sense here was that Netanyahu deserved the administration s condemnation not because of what he did but because of what he didn t do He failed to convey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden s visit symptomatic of his chaotic style of governing generally But not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir the former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State Baker with an announcement of the creation of another West Bank settlement Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U S on the Iranian threat ahead of the right wing political agenda That s why he included the Labor Party his coalition and why he accepted a two state solution an historic achievement that set the Likud however reluctantly within the mainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Biden during his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra Orthodox neighborhood Nor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra Orthodox Shas party which runs the interior ministry that oversees building procedures Shas which supports peace talks and territorial compromise is not a nationalist party Its interest is providing housing for its constituents like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo provoking international incidents is not its style Finally the very ordinariness of the building procedure the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is considered by Israelis routine is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden Apparently no one in the interior ministry could imagine that a long term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit In turning an incident a crisis Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking a pretext to pick a fight with Israel Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby Obama deliberately so Ac t cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma ariv senior Likud officials believe that Obama s goal is to topple the Netanyahu government by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition The popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel Given his ineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self imposed deadlines for sanctions the Israeli public is not likely to be impressed Indeed Israelis initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama According to an Israel Radio poll on percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis while percent blame Netanyahu Another percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai In the last year the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith even though the Palestinian Authority media has for example been waging a months long campaign denying the Jews historic roots in Jerusalem Just after Biden left Ramailah Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after a terrorist responsible for the massacre of Israeli civilians That too didn t merit an administration rebuke Obama s one sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of open season against Israel internationally Indeed the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to the resumption of the peace process as if it s Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table If the administration s main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem its main strategic error was assuming that a two state solution was within easy reach Shortly after Obama took office Rehm Emanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama s first tent instead a year later we are in the era of suspended proximity talks Now the administration is demanding that Israel negotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks as if Israelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them To insist on the imminent possibility of a two state solution requires amnesia Biden s plea to Israelis to consider a withdrawal to an approximation of the borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offer twice in the last decade first when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of and then more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas Abbas says Olmert never replied The reason for Palestinian rejection of a two state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine the return of the descendants of the refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel That would prevent a two state solution from devolving a bi national one state solution Israel s insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace To achieve eventual peace the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifa and Jaffa and confine their people s right of return to a future Palestinian state just as the Jews will need to forgo their claim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people s right of return to the state of Israel That is the only possible deal conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine A majority of Israelis along with the political system has accepted that principle On the Palestinian side the political system has rejected it In the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return negotiations should not focus on a two state solution but on more limited goals There have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years The rise of Hamas has created panic within Fatah and the result is for the first time genuine security cooperation with Israel Also the emergence of Salem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership though Fayyad still lacks a power base Finally the West Bank economy is growing thanks in part to Israel s removal of dozens of roadblocks The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends But by focusing on building in Jerusalem Obama has undermined that possibility too To the fictitious notion of a peace process Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process The administration according to a report in the Israeli ne Aispaper Yedito Aharonot is making an even more insidious accusation against Israel During his visit wrote Yediot Aharanot Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies are endangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq The report has been denied in the White House Whether or not the remark was made what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama s recklessness is endangering Israeli and Palestinian lives As I listen to police sirens outside my window Obama s political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning a third intifada over Jerusalem Yossi Klein Ha evils a senior fellow of the She em Center in Jerusalem and a contributing editor of The New Republic WM please be quiet pease Posted By I nikrionday Commentary s Jqr ifese e pp is reacting way out of proportion to par inclav morninitalk That said she s got a germ of a good point a political operative who now seems at the center of foreign policy formulation more on this later went on the Fox ABC and NBC talk shows to repeat how insulted the Obami were over Israeli building in Jerusalem and what an atf atet this was to them I t might have something to do with the fact that and the Chicago pols are running foreign policy It s attack attack attack just as they do any domestic critic Quibble away with Rubin s characterization of Chicago pols but she does raise a decent question why on God s green earth is the Obama equivalent of Karl Rove talking about foreign policy in public Since the tri from Hag its clear that the Obama administration has ratcheted up the rhetoric taiLvate irLpublic in press leaks and throupo r ib E r a oN n rq to their Israeli counterparts Given what transpired it s entirely ap oropriate that the Obama administration make its displeasure felt publicly Why however Sure the morning talk shows wanted to talk health care as well And it s true that thought of as pro Israel could send a tough signal Still couldn t the administration have sent Hillary Clinton to one of the morning talk shows instead Wouldn t she have been the more appropriate spokesman I ve spent enought time inside the Beltway to be leery of the

3080,FW: Economist: The limits of freedom and faith,See the piece below on defamation of religion Not bad http I www economist com world international displavstorv cfm story id Religion and human rights The limits of freedom and faith Mar st From The Economist print edition Opponents of a bid by Muslim states to protect religion claim a small success How dare you call us blasphemers IT DOES not happen often Christian lobbyists the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and crucifixes in Italian ones lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion s role in the public square But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the United Nations Not over the outcome but over the slim margin of defeat On th the Human Rights Council HRC a Geneva based UN agency which often exasperates its Western members voted by votes to with eight abstentions for a text that lists the defamation of religion as an infringement of liberty Nothing amazing there the Organisation of the Islamic Conference OIC which groups mainly Muslim states plus Palestine has been working to push resolutions of that kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since But the margin was the smallest ever and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a defamation motion next time one comes around The OIC s idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection just as individuals do It denies any sinister intention see article And to some ears the OIC s effort sounds like harmless UN speak but nothing more The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom a congressionally mandated body has noted a logical flaw defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or entity that implies that one can t defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer at least physically alive on earth But critics of the OIC campaign who include atheists Christians and indeed some Muslims say the defamation idea is worse than hot air far from protecting human rights it emboldens countries that use blasphemy laws to criminalise dissent What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be coming around to their view Mexico Uruguay Argentina Zambia and South Korea voted against the latest resolution Brazil criticised the text but abstained Deeper still inside the UN s bureaucracy another battle over religion rages and the stakes could be even higher An ad hoc committee is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial discrimination Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith some want a new convention or a protocol to the existing one For secularists in the broad sense of people including believers who oppose the idea of faith having privileged access to power all this is alarming Non binding resolutions against defamation are bad enough a UN treaty on race plus religion would have legal force at least for its signatories and give heart to theocrats At the HRC s latest discussion of this effort in the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to plough ahead But countries like Switzerland Japan Mexico Argentina and France retorted that it would be better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones Efforts to widen the racism accord will resume with a new chairman late this year but critics are relieved to have stalled it Still would be theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter because they face a real risk of being defeated over defamation in the view of Roy Brown Geneva spokesman for the International Humanist and Ethical Union Meanwhile a Christian inspired NGO the European Centre for Law and Justice has been denouncing the abuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states How fair is their point It is an easy case to make for example over Pakistan Some complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year says that country s independent Human Rights Commission In theory blasphemy is punishable by death a penalty that has been handed down but never carried out Worst hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis a group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state Although abuse of the law is less rife now than in the s when an Islamist general tightened up the rules the law is still invoked in disputes over property say that have nothing to do with faith The most vulnerable people that is religious minorities continue to be charged with blasphemy said Ali Dayan Hasan a researcher at Human Rights Watch a campaign group But are people convicted No Rarely It is used as an instrument of political and social coercion When convictions occur they lead to long jail terms and pre trial detention can last for years Pakistan s parliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits despite a vow by the ruling party to review the blasphemy laws Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its blasphemy regime On Pakistani streets the law has dire effects In in a village in Punjab province five Ahmadis a labourer and four children were charged with blasphemy They had supposedly written Prophet Muhammad on the wall of a mosque toilet The children were behind bars for nearly six months till the charge was quashed And last a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain It seems that his real crime however was affection for a Muslim woman A mob torched a church and many Christians had to flee He was taken to jail where he died a few days later His family alleged torture the authorities claimed suicide There was mayhem at the funeral and the country s Christians see picture were appalled In some places it is not the defamation of faith that threatens rights but measures that supposedly defend it

3152,H: latest news on NI. Empey Dumpty... Sid,UUP policing meeting with McGuinness breaks down after three minutes Latest row comes on eve of critical vote in Stormont assembly on transfer of justice powers from London to Belfast Henry McDonald Ireland correspondent quardian co uk GMT Article history A meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Northern Ireland s deputy first minister aimed at securing the party s support for the devolution of policing and justice broke down in acrimony this evening The encounter between Martin McGuinness and a UUP delegation lasted all of three minutes at Stormont The latest row comes on the eve of a critical vote in the Stormont assembly on transferring justice and policing powers from London to Belfast The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entire power sharing executive is dysfunctional Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powers unless it obtained concessions on education specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at Following the aborted meeting today the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinson the first minister who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party The UUP claimed it had been ejected from the deputy first minister s office A UUP spokesman said An ill tempered deputy first minister attempted to aggressively lecture the Ulster Unionist party on policing and justice He ridiculously accused us of being an anti agreement party Our delegation robustly reminded the deputy first minister that we were the party which brought power sharing government to Stormont Quite clearly dissent and disagreement are unacceptable to Sinn Fein unfortunately for Mr McGuinness a party voting against a motion with which it disagrees is basic normal democratic politics The spokesman added that McGuinness s angry and aggressive attempt to lecture the UUP was wholly unacceptable When challenged on his tone the meeting broke down The UUP will not take lectures on our commitment to devolution from Martin McGuinness If this is how Sinn Fein understands power sharing then it is small wonder that the Northern Ireland executive is dysfunctional If the DUP and Sinn Fein press ahead with the vote it is highly likely that the leader of the centrist non sectarian Alliance party Ford will become the first justice minister for Northern Ireland The SDLP will back the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly tomorrow However the nationalist party is angry that it is not being offered the justice ministry Under the rules governing the hand out of ministries in the power sharing government the SDLP are officially entitled to choose the next ministry The party opposes the appointment of Ford as justice minister but will still support the transfer of these powers as they want to be seen to continue to back the power sharing arrangement US Congress warns Cameron over danger of failed Ulster police deal Yes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month Nicholas Watt chief political correspondent guardian co uk GMT Article history US secretary of state Hillary Clinton is said to be concerned at Cameron s apparent failure to exert pressure on his UUP partners Photograph Karim Jaafar AFP Getty Images Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be emboldened to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he fails to persuade the Tories Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories electoral pact with the UUP a bipartisan group of US Congress members have demanded Cameron must aggressively encourage his partners to endorse the deal in a vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on At this defining moment in the peace process it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice about their shared future the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron Without a unanimous vote they said the province s elected officials would be sending the wrong message to the people they represent and to the world Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back These dissidents will continue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward The challenge of bringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is political stability The letter by congressional leaders of the million strong Irish American community has been passed to the Guardian before the crucial vote on last month s Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British government has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the Good agreement The congressmen and women whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state Hillary Clinton wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts about endorsing the deal Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed or not bothered to warn the UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal A Tory source said Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein The final details are for the parties in the executive working as a four party coalition to decide We hope that between now and any outstanding issues can be solved The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the largest party in Northern Ireland This says that any change must have the consent of of both the nationalist and Unionist communities and of the assembly Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good agreement will meet his party s executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP s assembly members account for more than of the unionist bloc But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from the UUP seen as a moribund force until Cameron breathed new life it would destabilise many members of the DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers US eyes on Northern Ireland in countdown to crucial peace vote Hillary Clinton the White House and Congressional leaders look for a yes vote in Belfast By Nick Watt Guardian For a few hours tomorrow the United States will turn its attention to Northern Ireland Democratic and Republican leaders will both be watching to see whether all mainstream political parties endorse the final stage in the implementation of the Good Agreement the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers Sir Reg Empey the leader of the Ulster Unionist party is meeting his executive tonight to decide whether to vote yes Empey has severe doubts about the deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party This would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month a key nationalist demand in return for the long standing unionist demand for a review of the way in which contentious parades are run Intense pressure is being placed on Empey to fall line Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state who has taken a keen interest in Northern Ireland since the peace process was launched in the early days of her husband s presidency spent minutes talking to Empey by phone according to BBC Northern Ireland But transatlantic pressure has also been brought to bear on the other side of the Irish Sea I reported this morning that a group of bipartisan US Congressmen have written to Cameron asking him to use his influence with the UUP which recently formed an electoral pact with the Tories to vote yes The unease among the US Congress members is shared by Hillary Clinton She is said to believe that Cameron would be well advised to follow the example of Major who was respected as an impartial referee The concerns in the US will raise questions about claims made in private recently by Hague The shadow foreign secretary is saying that despite their political differences he is forging a strong bond with Clinton But all sides need to be careful The Tories who support the deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP believe that ministers need to be careful about frightening the UUP with too much political pressure The government was this morning trumpeting a poll commissioned by them which showed overwhelming support among UUP voters for a yes vote But as Slugger O Toole notes there is some debate about the methodology It almost feels like the government want the UUP to vote no so they can draw one of Brown s beloved dividing lines and say we are to blame for it all going wrong one Tory tells me
3153,Conservatives final push,FYI see below I will send the Guardian article in a moment Look forward to discussing
3154,Guardian,US Congress warns Cameron over danger of failed Ulster police deal Yes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be emboldened to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he fails to persuade the Tories Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories electoral pact with the UUP a bipartisan group of US Congress members have demanded Cameron must aggressively encourage his partners to endorse the deal in a vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on At this defining moment in the peace process it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice about their shared future the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron Without a unanimous vote they said the province s elected officials would be sending the wrong message to the people they represent and to the world Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back These dissidents will continue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward The challenge of bringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is political stability The letter by congressional leaders of the million strong Irish American community has been passed to the Guardian before the crucial vote on last month s Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British government has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the Good agreement The congressmen and women whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state Hillary Clinton wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts about endorsing the deal Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed or not bothered to warn the UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal A Tory source said Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein The final details are for the parties in the executive working as a four party coalition to decide We hope that between now and any outstanding issues can be solved The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the largest party in Northern Ireland This says that any change must have the consent of of both the nationalist and Unionist communities and of the assembly Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good agreement will meet his party s executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP s assembly members account for more than of the unionist bloc But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from the UUP seen as a moribund force until Cameron breathed new life it would destabilise many members of the DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers

3158,"H: fyi, just broke in Guardian. Sid",Bush to Cameron don t derail Northern Ireland peace process Exclusive Former president urges Cameron to rein in Unionist partners Nicholas Watt quardian co uk GMT Article history Former US president Bush has called Cameron over his concerns for the Northern Ireland peace process Photograph Parsons PA The former US president Bush has made a direct plea to Cameron to support the Northern Ireland peace process amid widespread concern in the US about the Tories new electoral pact with the Ulster Unionists In his most active intervention since leaving the White House Bush took the rare step of calling the Conservative leader to ask him to use his influence to press his unionist partners to endorse the final stages of the year search for a settlement Bush who took a close interest in the peace process during his years in the White House telephoned Cameron last to ask him to plead with the UUP leader Sir Reg Empey to endorse the deal in a vote tomorrow in the Northern Ireland assembly Democrats and Republicans fear that the peace process could be undermined if the Ulster Unionist party formerly Northern Ireland s largest party which governed the province until direct rule was imposed in votes against the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers to Belfast While the UUP does not have enough votes to scupper the deal the White House fears a no vote from the UUP could undermine support for the settlement within the Democratic Unionist party and among the wider unionist community Cameron has faced intense pressure in recent months over his decision to form an electoral pact with the UUP which could provide him with crucial support if the general election leads to a hung parliament The pact has prompted fears in Washington that Cameron may abandon the even handed approach to Northern Ireland adopted by Major in the early years of the peace process The Guardian understands that the White House is so concerned that the US economic envoy to Northern Ireland Declan Kelly persuaded Bush to intervene The former president telephoned Cameron to ask him to use his influence to persuade Empey to vote for the deal There was a feeling that a conservative to conservative conversation was the right way to go about this said one source familiar with the transatlantic negotiations This conversation was borne out of the concern that Empey is holding out Another source familiar with the contact said This is the most active thing W Bush has done in his post presidency period He has been incredibly restrained and diplomatic since leaving the White House He has maintained radio silence One source familiar with thinking on Northern Ireland on both sides of the Atlantic added The fact that W Bush has decided to intervene is really significant He was interested in the peace process as president and appointed an envoy It is a general sign of how concerned people are in the US about what Cameron is up to A Tory source said Bush did have a conversation with Cameron It was a positive conversation underlined his commitment to the agreement and said we are doing all we can to support it But he said that we cannot force Sir Reg to vote for it Bush thanked and said I can see you are engaged The disclosure of Bush s intervention came as Empey met the executive of his party tonight to decide whether to endorse the deal brokered last month at Hillsborough Castle between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists that would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month B The UUP leader who is minister for employment and learning in the four party power sharing executive believes it is foolish to devolve the final set of powers while the coalition is struggling to function In a sign of Empey s unease about endorsing the deal a meeting between the UUP and the Sinn Fein deputy first minster Martin McGuinness broke up after just three minutes tonight The White House and political leaders across the spectrum in the US have been watching developments with care Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state today pleaded with Empey in a minute telephone call to support the deal A group of US Congress members wrote to Cameron last month to issue a stark warning that dissident terrorists will be emboldened to intensify their attacks if he fails to persuade the Tories partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process

Sid",rs kt sk T t o v A strif me me X SOPING fr IAa piNiorpi qiNel tAIS RFS INVitIViat SW W E r fr w if f i Time to break the fog of Middle East politics By Ignatius A Diplomats love ambiguity It allows them to fuzz up the hard parts of a negotiation the final status issues as they re often called and save them for later when the parties are more amenable to pressure This devotion to constructive ambiguity has been a hallmark of U S peacemaking on the Palestinian Israeli issue for years Rather than state the unpalatable concessions that most analysts recognize will be required for any viable settlement that Israelis must share sovereignty in Jerusalem and that Palestinians must give up the right of return to Israel successive U S administrations have tried to defer these unmentionables until later But the fog machine blew apart this month when the isr e Interipr i inista rndLinced du ripq visit ily Vde President Biden that Israel would build more housipg priits in lerusal erp The Obama administration was upset to put it mildly Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the housing announcement a deeply negative signal about U S Israeli relations and an insult In the ensuing hubbub over the crisis in U S Israeli relations there have been frantic attempts to pretend it was all a misunderstanding and pull the cloak of ambiguity back over the peace process But that s a mistake The East Jerusalem move wasn t an accident but an emphatic public statement of the Israeli right s rejection of concessions on Jerusalem Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been trying to play along with U S requests to fuzz the issue by avoiding provocative actions on Jerusalem But the right wing Shas party which controls the Interior Ministry basically called his bluff Freezing building in East Jerusalem is one of those things we cannot do said Dore Gold a right wing former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations And Avigdor Lieberman the Israeli foreign minister and a settler himself responded Can you imagine if they told Jews in New York they could not build or buy in Queens So what should the administration do now that the Israeli right has put Jerusalem squarely on the table despite the best efforts of the ambiguity addicted diplomats The administration s best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago which is to state clearly the basic principles that must frame these negotiations Those guidelines have been articulated well by Zbigniew Brzezinski the former national security adviser real sharing of Jerusalem no right of return for the Palestinians a return to the borders with mutual adjustments to allow for big Israeli settlement blocks and a demilitarized Palestinian state Every negotiation for the past four decades has converged toward those parameters The Obama administration debated whether to issue such a statement of principles a year ago when it began its peacemaking effort Launching negotiations with this big bang made sense to some officials including Gen Jim the national security adviser But the Middle East envoy argued that based on his experience in the Northern Ireland peace talks it was better to let the parties haggle before the United States stepped in with bridging proposals Rather than stating U S negotiating principles at the outset the Obama team decided instead to push Netanyahu on settlements The administration picked this fight in the flush of President Obama s first months in office confident that he was so strong and Netanyahu so weak that if it came to a showdown Netanyahu would cave The Israeli leader coolly bided his time dickering about procedural issues while Obama got weaker politically by the month Netanyahu finally agreed in to a temporary moratorium on new settlements but it excluded Jerusalem The administration should have seen what was coming In retrospect it seems clear that the step by step approach was a mistake Constructive ambiguity in this case proved destructive It allowed the Israeli right wing to perpetuate the idea that it could have it all obtain a peace deal without making concessions on Jerusalem And it allowed Netanyahu to continue his straddle Jerusalem is the hardest issue of all in the Israeli Palestinian negotiation and for that reason would be peacemakers have wanted to save it for last But this month s crisis makes that strategic waffling impossible Thanks to the Israeli right the Jerusalem issue is joined What s needed now is for Obama to announce that when negotiations begin the United States will state its views about Jerusalem and other key issues sketching the outlines of the deal that most Israelis and Palestinians want If Netanyahu refuses to play then we have a real crisis in U S Israeli relations

Conservative allies in Stormont Comments Henry McDonald and Sparrow quardian co uk GMT Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey walks past a TV monitor displaying the Northern Ireland chamber meeting at Stormont in Belfast today Photograph Peter Muhly AFP Getty Images The final part of the Northern Ireland devolution deal was put in place today giving the province its first justice minister since the Troubles erupted four decades ago Nationalists and unionists in the Stormont parliament voted together to create the new justice ministry completing the last act of the Good agreement But there was discord inside the Stormont parliament after the Conservatives allies in Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionists and their strong assembly team voted against the move Despite an th hour intervention by Cameron imploring the UUP to vote yes the party refused to back the historic measure The party s stance puts Cameron in a difficult position he is in favour of the devolution of justice to Belfast but his electoral pact with the UUP risks exposing him to criticism that a Conservative government could not claim to be an honest broker when there are disagreements between the parties at Stormont Today s vote came just before pm when assembly members from Sinn Fein and the DUP joined the SDLP and smaller parties to back the transfer of policing and judicial powers to Belfast But the UUP resisted pressure from among others former US president Bush to support the measure Speaking on the assembly floor Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader said his party had voted no as a democratic political to a friend hare end IL i r ontact us er I smaller party pledged to making power sharing work in an inclusive manner for all the people of Northern Ireland and we exercise our rights refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks The deputy first minister Sinn Fein s Martin McGuinness earlier denounced the UUP stance claiming it was intended to embarrass the DUP The UUP declared last night that they will not support this resolution McGuinness told the assembly That saddens and disappoints me They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons In a statement after the vote Brown praised the parties which backed the deal Today the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland the prime minister said The completion of devolution supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland is the final end to decades of strife It sends the most powerful message to those who would return to violence that democracy and tolerance will prevail The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world The Conservatives welcomed the vote without mentioning the UUP s rejection of the move A Tory spokesman said We welcome the fact that devolution of policing and justice is going to happen We wanted all four parties to be involved and for it to be decided by local politicians But the Liberal Democrats called on Cameron to clarify the position of his Tory UUP alliance on the devolution of policing and justice powers Alistair Carmichael their spokesman on Northern Ireland said With the UUP saying one thing and the Tories saying the complete opposite voters will struggle to understand what exactly joint Tory UUP candidates stand for What we re seeing is the Tories in complete disarray When it takes Bush to step in as the voice of reason it s clear that Cameron has dug himself a very big hole Carmichael added This raises serious questions about Cameron s judgment If he can t manage to steer a straight course in opposition how on earth would he cope as prime minister Earlier there was acrimony in the Great Hall at Stormont when a victims campaigner attempted to serve a civil writ against McGuinness Willie Frazer of the group Families Acting for Innocent Relatives threw the legal document in McGuinness s direction after the deputy first minister refused to take it off him Frazer is taking a civil action in Belfast high court against the Sinn Fein MP because he alleges McGuinness directed the IRA s campaign during the Troubles The south Armagh unionist s father was shot dead by the IRA The FAIR spokesman said he had chosen yesterday because the DUP had betrayed me and other victims by agreeing to devolve policing and justice powers Frazer predicted that Sinn Fein would exercise a major influence over the police and judiciary even though the centrist non sectarian Alliance party leader Ford will be the first justice minister Frazer said I am very disappointed in the DUP because for years they said the things victims wanted to hear and now they have done a complete somersault All along they told me that Sinn Fein would never get their hands on policing and justice but they have a say Mr Ford is answerable to the executive and that means the deputy first minister Martin McGuinness That is why the only action left to me is a civil action I feel very let down by a number of DUP people The DUP will suffer at the polls for this U turn Frazer

iiTuardian co uk V Search Stormont votes to take over Northern Ireland policing powers Power sharing finalised as assembly agrees to first justice minister since Troubles Ulster Unionists oppose measure but Hillary Clinton welcomes assembly s yes vote A year search for a political settlement in Northern Ireland cleared its final hurdle today when unionists and nationalists voted to transfer policing and criminal justice powers to Belfast creating the province s first justice minister since the Troubles erupted four decades ago Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party DUP who were barely on speaking terms a few years ago joined forces with the nationalist SDLP in the Northern Ireland assembly to endorse a deal on policing hammered out last month The justice minister will be appointed on and is likely to be Ford the leader of the centrist Alliance party The breakthrough was marred by a row when the Ulster Unionist party UUP which governed Northern Ireland for five decades until the imposition of direct rule in voted against the deal Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who recently formed an electoral pact with the Conservatives said he had voted no because his party did not believe that the four party power sharing executive was functioning properly Empey the minister for employment and learning said We exercise our rights refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks The UUP hit out after facing intense pressure from London and the US to fall in behind Cameron who has backed devolution of the criminal justice system Brown phoned Empey shortly before today s vote while former US president Bush pleaded with Cameron last week to persuade the UUP to support the deal Empey s unionist rivals the DUP who have overtaken the UUP in recent years focused on what could happen after the vote The DUP leader Peter Robinson who managed to persuade all but one of his assembly members to back the devolution deal said The move is about completing and maintaining devolution it is about whether we move forward together as a society The vote secures an extra m for policing and justice that Brown promised the assembly if they backed the transfer It also adds an extra police officers The prime minister praised the main parties for reaching the deal on an issue that almost broke the power sharing government He said Today the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland The completion of devolution supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland is the final end to decades of strife It sends the most powerful message to those who would return to violence that democracy and tolerance will prevail The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world The vote was also praised tonight by Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state She said I commend the Northern Ireland Assembly for its affirmation of the Hillsborough Agreement and its endorsement of the devolution of policing and justice an important step in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future for all of the people of Northern Ireland for generations to come Irish president Mary McAleese also hailed the move Today s vote in the Northern Ireland assembly represents an eloquent statement of confidence in the political institutions established under the Good Agreement she said Matt Baggott chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland welcomed the vote as a step forward Devolution will strengthen our service It will help to ensure communities receive the policing service that not only they deserve but that we are committed to delivering The financial package is also welcomed it will help us deal with those who are living in the darkness of the past and who have tried to disrupt this process and the lives of our community But there was discord inside Stormont after the UUP and their strong assembly team voted against the move Martin McGuinness Sinn Fein s deputy first minister denounced the UUP stance claiming they were doing it to embarrass the DUP The UUP declared last night that they will not support this resolution McGuinness told the assembly That saddens and disappoints me They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons He stressed that no single party could control the justice department The UUP no vote will put pressure on the Tories who will campaign with their allies in the general election having taken opposing sides on the biggest vote since the DUP and Sinn Fein started sharing power in Cameron insisted that the Tories had played a constructive role saying he would maintain his alliance with the UUP We want to move Northern Ireland politics forward to focus on the issues that affect people in their everyday lives rather than remaining stuck in the past That is why we remain totally committed to bringing national mainstream UK politics to Northern Ireland and to ending its semi detached political status Cameron s remarks were designed in part to reassure the White House which fears a UUP no vote could harden unionist opinion against power sharing Hardline Unionists turned on the DUP tonight Jim Allister the former DUP MEP who now leads the breakaway Traditional Unionist Voice claimed his former party had rolled over in triple somersaults for Sinn Fein He also suggested the new justice minister would be a pointless puppet keeping the seat warm for Sinn Fein Prior to the vote the widow of the first Police Service of Northern Ireland officer to be murdered by dissident republicans urged all parties to back the devolution of policing and justice powers Kate Carroll whose husband Stephen was killed by a Continuity IRA sniper said in an appeal to the UUP It is heartbreaking that I have to get on this morning to please ask the politicians to get on with their job

3218,WSJ article,Below is the article I mentioned U S Revises Tack on Mideast Arms Washington Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons in Effort to Steal Iran s Thunder at U N Conference By JONATHAN WEISMAN JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA The U S is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons as the U S seeks to prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U N conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins U S officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington criticized by some for its silence about Israel s undeclared nuclear arsenal will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region as Iran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program Washington also reassured Israel it won t foist a nuclear free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant progress has been made on Mideast peace The U N conference on the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty which is held every five years is expected to begin with a bang with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who has condemned the West for its refusal to disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel s nuclear capability Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon The U N talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U S and allies have been pressing for new tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran s program The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party said a senior U S official involved in the nuclear diplomacy The official highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear free zone issues The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged from a U N review of the Non Proliferation Treaty a pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons That agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty but no action on the zone has been taken since Senior Obama administration officials said the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear weapons free zone and would support a conference on the subject at a future date U S officials said talks with Egypt would resume in New York in the coming month Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel the Arab states Iran and Turkey We ve made a proposal to them Egypt that goes beyond what the U S has been willing to do before said the senior U S official involved in the nuclear diplomacy U S officials stressed however that they didn t believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in Arab Israeli peace talks We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate which would be unlikely unless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted said undersecretary of state for arms control and international security She said the U S has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members of the Nonaligned Movement The diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel Israel has voiced concerns that the U N conference could turn an international forum to corner Israel Mr Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear security conference in Washington in due to such concerns An Israeli official said that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons but that it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the countries in the region The U S and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr Obama s calls for a complete freeze in building new Jewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem U S officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that ties between the U S and Israel have stabilized Mrs Clinton said that the Mideast peace process will get on track next week though not the U S brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration wants to see Egypt s latest proposal calls for Israel s disarmament as soon as possible It also called for Israel s nuclear program to be placed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency the U N s atomic watchdog That proposal won t be accepted U S officials said The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release all information available to them on the nature and scope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel U S officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel Arms control analysts familiar with the talks say the U S is likely to propose creating a U N envoy given the task of calling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon free zone They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections said Henry Sokolski executive director of the Non Proliferation Education Center and a critic of the Obama administration s arms control approach Daryl Kimball executive director of the Arms Control Association an advocacy group said the U S acceptance of a special envoy is a significant shift A U S official refused to say whether the envoy proposal first floated by Russia was part of the U S offer The last NPT conference in ended in collapse But U S officials said they have been laying the groundwork for this conference for nearly a year The White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn t escape inspections and sanctions They also want more power for U N inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could help nations develop peaceful nuclear power Write to Jonathan Weisman at jonathan weisman wsj com Jay Solomon at jay solomon wsj com and Joe Lauria at newseditor wsj com

article by Max who spends his time on this issue and plans to move to Israel for about months to write a book He tracks a lot of things that do not appear in the mainstream press Sid http mideast foreignpolicy com posts the petraeus briefing biden s embarrassment is not the whole sto ry The Petraeus briefing Biden s embarrassment is not the whole story Posted By Mark Perry On Jan two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti a team of senior military officers from the U S Central Command responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm Mullen on the Israeli Palestinian conflict The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM commander Gen Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue The slide minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among Arab leaders that the U S was incapable of standing up to Israel that CENTCOM s mostly Arab constituency was losing faith in American promises that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U S standing in the region and that himself was as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it too old too slow and too late The Mullen briefing was unprecedented No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on what is essentially a political issue which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed from a tour of the region where on Petraeus s instructions they spoke to senior Arab leaders Everywhere they went the message was pretty humbling a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says America was not only viewed as weak but its military posture in the region was eroding But Petraeus wasn t finished two days after the Mullen briefing Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza which with Israel is a part of the European Command or EUCOM be made a part of his area of operations Petraeus s reason was straightforward with U S troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan the U S military had to be perceived by Arab leaders as engaged in the region s most troublesome conflict UPDATE A senior military officer denied that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue and CENTCOM did propose a UCP change but to CJCS not to the WH the officer said via email GEN Petraeus was not certain what might have been conveyed to the WH if anything from that brief to CJCS UCP means unified combatant command like CENTCOM CJCS refers to Mullen and WH is the White House The Mullen briefing and Petraeus s request hit the White House like a bombshell While Petraeus s request that CENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied it was dead on arrival a Pentagon officer confirms the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue sending on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the chief of the Israeli General Staff Lt General Gabi Ashkenazi While the American press speculated that Mullen s trip focused on Iran the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt and tough message on the Israeli Palestinian conflict that Israel had to see its conflict with the Palestinians in a larger regional context as having a direct impact on America s status in the region Certainly it was thought Israel would get the message Israel didn t When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu government was building new homes in East Jerusalem the administration reacted But no one was more outraged than Biden who according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth engaged in a private and angry exchange with the Israeli Prime Minister Not surprisingly what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to Petraeus s Mullen briefing This is starting to get dangerous for us Biden reportedly told Netanyahu What you re doing here undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq Afghanistan and Pakistan That endangers us and it endangers regional peace Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since many people in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel s actions and US policy any decision about construction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of American troops fighting against Islamic terrorism The message couldn t be plainer Israel s intransigence could cost American lives There are important and powerful lobbies in America the NRA the American Medical Association the lawyers and the Israeli lobby But no lobby is as important or as powerful as the U S military While commentators and pundits might reflect that Joe Biden s trip to Israel has forever shifted America s relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region the real break came in when Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning America s relationship with Israel is important but not as important as the lives of America s soldiers Maybe Israel gets the message now Mark Perry s newest book is Talking To Terrorists http warincontext org olo o israel is putting american liyes at risk My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment as well as some skepticism how accurate is the account Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda whether that is a desire to expand CENTCOM or even hostility towards Israel I won t name my sources even though it s clear to people in the Pentagon and certainly to General Petraeus who they are Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves I will only say that there were four people in the briefing the two briefers Admiral Mullen and Admiral Mullen s primary adviser on the Israeli Palestinian conflict I know two of the people involved in the briefing Whether or not they are my sources is something for the reader to determine The account is not only accurate it s a precis of what actually happened There is a lot more to it The White House State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account and for good reason it s true Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff Four Stars is the authoritative account on the subject I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years I have never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire There is no greater insult than to believe that General Petraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhance their own political future My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel but he loves his country and he wants to protect our soldiers The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test of General Petraeus s loyalty to Israel but of his and our concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East It is perhaps a sign of the depth of the Biden crisis that every controversy of this type seems to get translated whether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel s security This isn t about Israel s security it s about our security http maxblumenthal com pastor hagee and netanyahus lovefest on eve of bidens arrival in israel Netanyahu and Pastor Hagee s Lovefest on Eve of Biden s Arrival in Israel On By Max Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick more videos coming shortly Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved the construction of new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U S wishes and complicating Biden s mission to help jump start the peace process But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset his plans by Netanyahu s appearance with Hagee The day after a series of talks between US Envoy for the Middle East and Netanyahu and a day before Biden s arrival Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor Hagee in Jerusalem The occasion was Hagee s Night To Honor Israel an event the far right Texas based preacher arranged to tout his ministry s millions in donations to Israeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel s perceived enemies At the gathering Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the Hitler of the Middle East and denounced the Goldstone Report as character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of American evangelicals to Jerusalem a city he described as the undivided eternal capitol of the Jewish people Then he told them I salute you The Jewish people salute you He used the rest of his speech to call for tough biting sanctions against Iran that bite deep its energy sector Hagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage r X In the audience were top level members of the Israeli government from Ambassador Oren to Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin the chief rabbi of the illegal West Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend fugitive billionaire Marc Rich Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressional delegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street Part One of Hagee s speech X Part Two X Pastor Hagee in Jerusalem Part II from Max J on Vimeo Hagee s ceremony featured a minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from Hagee Ministries that totaled million since The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion and Shomron which was involved in promoting an Obama Hilltop project that promoted more settlement building and compared Obama to Pharoah Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated from Gush Katif in Gaza in During Israel s assault on Gaza in a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israel government to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region Who is Hagee funding in Israel X Who Is Haoee Funding In Israel from Max on Vimeo The most notable of Hagee s funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu A student representative of this group appeared in the film to thank Hagee for help ing us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path the path of Zionism the love of Israel the path of solidarity Another student called for the second revolution in Israel In Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director Naomi Chazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head The group misleadingly accused the New Israel Fund of bankrolling human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report The smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israeli human rights groups Meanwhile the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation Gideon Levy a columnist for Ha aretz called Im Tirtzu a McCarthyite movement for its attacks on Chazan Although CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu s campaign the organization s appearance during CUFI s Jerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well the future Republican Senator McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his presidential campaign after Hagee s statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light Hagee has also said that he believed the anti Christ was partially Jewish as was Adolph Hitler However none of Hagee s comments have deterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity During Hagee s speech he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source of difficulties between the US and Israel The settlements are not the problem he boomed from the podium The problem is the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East Hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when he proclaimed World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do in the city of Jerusalem They don t have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build who can and and cannot live there The following day on Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials from the Palestinian Authority He told reporters after touching down that he saw a moment of real opportunity

3425,H: early review. Sid,H Jim Fellows told me he was at your speech and thrilled by it He s just returned from three years in China He didn t expect you would be so frank Here s his post on The Atlantic website Sid http jamesfallows theatiantic comiarchives a momentous hours php more Xr Hi ary Clinton s Internet freedom speech iVian A momentous hours leading to Clinton China Internet Jan pm Apart from two obvious pieces of momentous news in the past day and a half the new junior Senator from Massachusetts and the new ckv V V rvi c by which I mean today s lamentable straight party line Supreme Court ruline that removes limits from direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns there is one other event today that will have big ripple effects i mean SecState Hillary Clinton s speech this morning about Internet Freedom mentioned lere and with a prelude discussion I m not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech Instead I highly recommend reading the full text lette or watching the official video tere And for now some of the main points while listening and noting main points down in real time with the handy uiveaSccibe pen In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago I m not naming names but I remember when many people imagined that info technology by itself would undermine oppression and bring the world together Clinton started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology like others was neither good or bad in itself and is already being used in both helpful and destructive ways Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity we must also recognize that these technologies are not an unmitigated blessing These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns or nuclear power can either energize a city or destroy it modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for good or for ill The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent And technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent and deny human rights And a very nice pivot out of this section effective because it s so blunt and plain On their own new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress but the United States does Underscoring the this is a big deal tone of the speech she enumerated the Four Freedoms that FDR proclaimed in as part of the struggle for the world s future and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the Internet age Check out the speech yourself for details The China surprise the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I expected and than I recall in other US China interactions in a very long time For instance early in the speech an itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse In the last year we ve seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information China Tunisia and Uzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet In Vietnam access to popular social networking sites has suddenly disappeared And last in Egypt bloggers and activists were detained Tunisia Uzbekistan Vietnam Egypt this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government in its recent sense of rise to superpower status is used to being lumped with Compared to the US as a financial power OK overtaking japan in economic size yes being a crucial player in environmental negotiations all that is one thing Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different Sentences like this don t appear in formal big deal SecState addresses by accident Other passages to the same effect As I speak to you today government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history But history itself has already condemned these tactics Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy our government and our civil society Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation And then the Google section itself I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name and had reason to think it might not Main argument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case in the company s ongoing efforts to find a il lvineyiftaiv in acceptable way to remain in China rather than a lose lose lose permanent split its not necessarily a help to have the U S government standing officially by its side But the way Sec Clinton introduced the point was significant as a proxy for China s own ability to H to tentiai and sustain its economic rise To use market terminology a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an environment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society If corporate decision makers don t have access to global sources of news and information investors will have less confidence in their decisions over the long term Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint there is no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type of information it will inevitably impact on growth Increasingly U S companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration in their business decisions I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China and it is fabulous There are so many people in China now online But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century Now the United States and China have different views on this issue and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive cooperative and comprehensive relationship There s a lot more in the speech including about terrorism disaster relief religion etc but it s there for the reading Back to the to do list for me now Peirmalink Share This

3445,FW: Aceh Background,FYI From one of the folks we hired who had been working with Pierre Louis Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi Donor Trust Fund The Government of Indonesia G responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated response The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment DLA The DLA was followed by a more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction MPRR The MPRR provided in depth sector plans spatial planning the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption The process behind the MPRR was consultative with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard The MPRR was presented on only months after the Tsunami The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three stage strategy The Relief phase was originally set to six months but was then reduced to three The Rehabilitation phase is to run for about months through and the Reconstruction phase from through The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief rescue food and medicine emergency infrastructure and temporary shelter and burying the dead The Rehabilitation phase is to restore services to minimum level public services economic facilities banking and financial institutions trauma treatments secure land rights law and order and temporary shelter Finally Reconstruction is to rebuild the region rebuilding the economy production trade and banking the transportation telecommunications and social and cultural systems improving institutional capacity and housing The Government set up a ministerial level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias The BRR was formally established end and became operational early The World Bank Board on formally established the Multi Donor Trust Fund MDF with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR GOI donors and civil society Having a credible local coordinators was key to success The EC channels nearly of its funds through the MDF while only of USD million from the US goes to the MDF While payments the fund were slow disbursements out of it were to begin with even slower By project agreements for about USD million had been signed but only USD million had actually been disbursed Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter The delay was caused by two principal impediments first donors were quick to pledge funds but getting all the exact written agreements in place took time This points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding formal agreements and accept simple generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of slightly differing phrasings and concerns Second the processing time for project approval and implementation was a concern Since the MDF was to have funded projects on budget they had to be implemented by government institutions This crated bottlenecks Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this They want the Bank to assume fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high risk environment and also to take a lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized activities The MDF is thus seen a well managed bank account with some paid for administrative services However the all inclusive Steering Committee made membership large and to some extent unwieldy and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk shows field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as well as a telephone hotline MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia G in policy dialogue The MDF is thus an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability relevance and impact Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions though it does allow for preference indications it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the criteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to Given strong GOI participation the MDF is seen as the most successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been criticized for a lack of coordination The MDF s Mid Term Review conducted in found that the MDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the reconstruction effort The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy The MDF lacked executive rights but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response

3482,"fyi, going around...",Are the Mideast Policy Team by Leslie H Gelb I pm I ri IPresident Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House Gary Fabiano Sipa Press Obama s bow to Netanyahu was just the latest in a series of disastrous missteps in U S policy toward Israel Leslie H Gelb on who s to blame and how the White House can get back on course Whoever advised President Obama to flay Israel publicly until this week should be fired Only advisers with no experience in dealing with Israel could have believed that Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow to public attacks And whoever advised Mr Obama to kneel rhetorically to Mr Netanyahu in public on should also be fired The only thing accomplished by this embarrassing tactic was to put Israel in a position to call the shots on Mideast policy for the rest of Obama s first term The real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time it s failure Were the culprits the non foreign policy White House intimates chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and political honcho knows nothing about this and worse Emanuel thinks he does because he lived in Israel Was the president s Mideast negotiator the brains behind the foolishness Surely he s had enough experience working with Israelis to know better Did General the National Security Adviser remain silent again And of course where was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Strangely for someone so adept at pleasing Israel s constituents in America she spent a lot of time this past year publicly beating up on Israeli leaders Has she been led astray by the pro Arab contingent of the State Department Martin Indyk New Hope for Mideast Peace Peter Beinart Netanyahu s Latest Insult Or is the guilty party none other than President Obama himself The more we find out about who makes decisions in the White House on every subject from nuclear weapons to coloring of Easter eggs it turns out to be the man in the Oval Office himself He s the expert He s the decider He invites everyone to state his or her piece or peace then he tells them what to do and seemingly without question they do his bidding Mr Obama started his White House tenure from a near zero base of foreign policy knowledge and no experience in the Middle East It was easy enough to guess this blissful state from his earliest decisions He came out of the box demanding that Israel agree to suspend construction on the West Bank as a precondition for direct negotiations with the Palestinians Anyone who knew anything about this situation surely would have told the president that the chances of Mr Netanyahu agreeing to this proposal were zero or minus zero No Israeli leader even a dovish one would ever dream of beginning negotiations by conceding his major bargaining card As the teenagers say what were Obama and his advisers thinking And yes after the Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden during his trip to the Holy Land by announcing they would start new construction in East Jerusalem Washington had to respond vehemently The Israelis had been arrogant and stupid on this one They had weakened American power in the region No U S president could let them get away with it Clinton and others made strong public statements of criticism and those were fine But Mr Obama then allowed Mr Netanyahu to come ahead with his planned visit to D C and publicly humiliated him The U S president let the Israeli prime minister cool his heels for hours before meeting with him then wouldn t shake his hand when he departed There s no surer way to unite a nation behind its leader even a controversial one like Netanyahu than to have a foreign leader humiliate him This brilliant tactic thought of by Obama s advisers or the president himself accomplished two things It stiffened Israeli backs even further against being conciliatory about starting talks with the Palestinians The Israeli government was not about to cave to American pressures It also galvanized Israeli supporters in the United States in particular within conservative parts of the Jewish community and the Republican Party There went Mr Obama s support for pressing Israel even in private To top this all off with s meeting full of smiles and the adoption of Israeli desired language on almost every topic only made matters worse It made the situation look as if the American president had been cowed by Jewish control of American politics That certainly pleased American and Israeli hawks but it did not please others who want to see genuine progress in Mideast talks There is a time and place for Washington to put pressure on Israel Mr Obama and his team picked every wrong time and place The right occasion to squeeze is when the negotiations have reached the point where both sides have given and where both must give more to close the deal Only at that point does pressure make sense All parties would get a real shot at peace in return for their concessions To be sure many ask at this point How do you get to that point The answer is not to browbeat the parties to scurry to the negotiating table That tactic simply never pays off The answer is to build conditions beyond the negotiating table conditions in the political community in both Israel and Palestine that would support compromises at the table The British pushed the Catholics and Protestants to make concessions year after year only to fail time and again only to further inflame feelings all around and spur greater violence Finally London focused on getting Protestant and Catholic women to form common groups to support compromise London did as much with various business communities that evolved backers of mutual concessions as well Only then did parties know that they had support for compromises their negotiations got somewhere and they reached agreement That s what needs to be done between Israel and the Palestinians We hear time and again that the enemy of peace in the Middle East is time and that time is running out Perhaps that is what has caused Mr Obama and his team to misstep so badly they think it s a race against the clock Do something now or fail But the real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time it s failure Neither Israel nor the Palestinians nor the United States can afford to fail again After yet another failure it could well result in perpetual violence To set his Arab Israeli policy on a sensible course Mr Obama needs to search for new advisors who know how to get things done in the Middle East hire them and listen to them Leslie H Gelb a former New York Times columnist and senior government official is author of Power Rules How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy

3502,fyi,http www bloomberq com news americans disappoving of obama policies poised to enable republican dains html Americans Disapproving Obama Poised to Enable Republican Gains By McCormick and Catherine Dodge Jul Email Share Print Chart Poll Results Attachment Poll results and methodology Americans disapprove of U S President Barack Obama s handling of almost every major issue and are deeply pessimistic about the nation s direction offering a bullish environment for Republicans in the congressional elections A majority or plurality disapproves of Obama s management of the economy health care the budget deficit the overhaul of financial market regulations and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico according to a Bloomberg National Poll conducted In addition almost in respondents say the war in Afghanistan is a lost cause Almost two thirds say they feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction an even more sour assessment than in when percent felt that way Two thirds of independent voters are pessimistic while just percent of Democrats offer a vote of confidence They don t see any solutions in sight said J Ann Selzer president of Selzer Co a Des Moines Iowa based firm that conducted the nationwide survey They have been hammered by the economy and there is a disconnect between the lives Americans are living and Washington They seem to have lost hope Poll respondents are divided on their congressional preference between Democrats and Republicans with both sides getting percent support Among those who say they are most likely to vote Republicans are favored percent to percent The Republican advantage is even greater among likely voters who view the election as exceptionally important with Republicans beating Democrats percent to percent Control of Congress For the Democrats whd control Congress and the White House the survey shows the potential for losses in when voters will fill all House seats Senate seats and governorships The outcome could affect Pam s ability to move his agenda through Congress for the two years leading up to his own re election bid The fate of incumbents will depend to some extent on what happens to the economy in the next four months and whether unemployment drops much from its current percent A rising stock market could help as well So far this year the S P stock index has declined percent The public s disenchantment with the president s Policies doesn t extend to voter feelings about Obama himself as he gets a job approval rating of percent and personally is viewed favorably by percent Obama remains more popular than any of the Republican figures tested in the poll and is topped only by Secretary of State aity ant cn and General Da td Petraeos the new commander of U S forces in Afghanistan among a list of people and political parties reviewed Republican Leaders The only bright spot for Republican candidates is for Louisiana Governor Eiob i tele who gets a percent favorable rating and an percent unfavorable grade Better known party leaders such as former vice presidential candidate a et n and former House Speaker Netf ri CirigPait both have negative ratings that outweigh the positive views Although turnout in midterm elections is historically lower than in presidential races the electorate is interested Four fifths of Americans who plan to vote say s election is very or exceptionally important The likelihood to vote is strongest among older voters Republicans and those with the highest incomes Among those and older three quarters say they will definitely vote compared with percent of those younger than Four fifths of Republicans say they will definitely vote compared with percent of Democrats and percent of independents Referendum on barna Seeking to capitalize on the intensity expressed by voters Republicans want to make the election a national referendum on Obama and the party in power while the White House and Democrats argue it is about going forward rather than backward to failed policies The challenge for Democrats will be to translate their vision of a better future more positive feelings about the economy among voters In the poll Republicans have the advantage among the independents often critical to winning elections Among independents likely to vote Republican congressional candidates are preferred to Democrats percent to percent Anything that has been tried hasn t resulted in making anything better in the world where ordinary people live Selzer said That s a bad scenario for incumbents of the majority party Incumbent Disadvantage A third of poll participants say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who has served in Congress for many years About one fifth of likely voters say the election is more about sending a message while three quarters say it is about picking the party that has the best ideas I don t know what these people are thinking in Washington says poll respondent Jeff Lockman a professional golfer and Republican from Malvern Pennsylvania They are going in different directions and they really don t know what to focus on The proportion who feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction is about the same as at this poin t in when Republicans took control of Congress and when Democrats took over The public also has soured on Obama s foreign policy priority the war in Afghanistan While the president has ordered an expansion of forces to turn the tide in a conflict where he says the U S has a critical stake percent say it is a lost cause compared with percent who say it can still be won A slim majority of Republicans percent say the U S can still win in Afghanistan while percent of Democrats say the conflict is lost Afghanistan Withdrawal Six in Americans say it would be best to stick with Obarna s plan to start withdrawing forces in while one third say they remain open to keeping the same number of troops there or even adding additional forces Reflecting the belief among many that the war cannot be won a third of Americans say they have become less supportive of the effort there in recent months The Bloomberg National Poll is based on interviews with U S adults ages or older Percentages based on the full sample may have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus percentage points r yr cwrra who studies public opinion at the A necicar Entarpr F e institute a public policy research group in Washington cails the poll very very grim news for the Democrats At the same time she says one silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans have yet to convince voters that they have a plan Obarna Visit One signpost for Democrats in the poll is the finding that just percent of Americans say it would help a Democratic candidate in their area to get a visit from Obama while percent say it would hurt the candidate and percent say it wouldn t matter or they don t know Obama s worst ratings are for his handling of the budget deficit where percent disapprove and percent approve It s his worst grade for that subject in any of four Bloomberg polls taken since The Obama administration expects a record budget deficit this year of more than trillion or percent of GDP according to projections the White House released in It was trillion for the fiscal year which covers the end ofGecrge W Bush s presidency and Obama has said that the current fiscal shortfall as well as theunemployment rate are inheritances from his Republican predecessor s administration My biggest fear is we have people in government who don t have a clue about what is going on in the economy says poll respondent Jim Heeter from Glendale Arizona They have never run a business or had to make a payroll Economy Health Care Slim majorities disapprove of Obama s handling of the economy and health care When it comes to creating jobs he gets percent approval addressing problems on Wall Street percent support running the war in Afghanistan percent approve and managing the BP Plc oil spill percent support Forty five percent say they have become more supportive in recent months of tougher regulations for Wall Street The momentum is heading in the opposite direction from the White House and Democrats on most other issues Almost half say they have become less supportive in recent months of federal money being loaned to automotive companies to help them stay in business while percent have become less supportive of the health care overhaul passed by Congress earlier this year A majority percent say the nation should wait and see how the health care legislation works or leave it alone while percent want to see it repealed Arizona Immigration Law Almost half of Americans say they have also grown more supportive of allowing local law enforcement to detain anyone who can t produce proof of citizenship when stopped for an offense as is contemplated in an Arizona law Cbama has criticized the measure and the Justice Department has announced it plans to sue Arizona At least half of respondents also say they would be less likely to support candidates who voted to give financial assistance to the banking or automobile industries Americans are roughly divided on whether they would be more or less likely to support a candidate who voted against extending unemployment benefits because of concern over the cost A measure providing such support worth billion is stalled in Congress Clinton Popularity The disaffection with Obarna and Democrats doesn t carry over to all Democrats Hillary Clinton is viewed favorably by percent of respondents and a quarter of Americans including percent of Republicans and percent of Democrats say the nation would be in a better place if she had been elected president The Tea Party movement which has been mainly associated with Republicans has lukewarm support in the poll A majority of percent of all respondents says it would make no difference to them if a candidate was backed by Tea Party activists while a third of Republicans say that kind of backing would make a candidate more appealing to them Those who are more likely to think the Tea Party is a simplistic and misguided movement percent of all respondents include Democrats percent and those with the highest incomes percent Independent voters are divided on whether it is misguided or has rightly identified that the nation would be better served by reduced federal government compared with percent overall

3510,American University of Central Asia,Madam Secretary In advance of your meeting tomorrow with Soros below is some information in response to the letter you received from Soros proposing increased USG support for the American University of Central Asia AUCA SCA favors providing more USG support for AUCA Since the United States has provided more than million to AUCA in support of its endowment and various other initiatives For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars provided by the USG The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment the first in for million the second in for million Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to the AUCA president on accreditation and development support for the journalism faculty and scholarship funds for students from Tajikistan Turkmenistan and Afghanistan to attend the university Soros has proposed that the USG increase this support offering a match of million each from State and his foundation totaling million over the next five years Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros and they have been discussing the issue with Soros staff A little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA The university has made significant progress this year on a number of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia a place where students are judged solely on merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking The university achieved an important milestone this year related to its U S accreditation signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next will receive full diplomas from Bard College an institution accredited in the United States In addition AUCA recently established a new partnership with the American University in Kabul facilitated through state of the art video classroom technology and recently announced the appointment of Wachtel from Northwestern University as the new AUCA president who will take office this summer I will include this note in addition to Soros letter in your materials for your meeting with Soros tomorrow Please let me know if you would like any further information Thanks Mike H U S Department of State

3513,H: Best commentary. Sid,It was worse than a crime It was a blunder Talleyrand
3514,H: Jeremy Greenstock has an interesting approach. Sid,Gaza it s Hamas s move now Hamas must seize the initiative if there is ever to be an end to Israel s occupation of Palestine c Jeremy Greenstock o quardian co uk BST So it has happened again Nearly months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland with barely a load of building materials allowed in since then Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and if laws have been broken those responsible must be held to account Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to prevent weapons being smuggled Gaza But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate No one should have been hurt whatever the emotions behind all this Why is Gaza under siege in the first place Under international law the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for the proper administration of the territory and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law Yet they are creating a traumatised territory of m neighbours many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers They are also pouring fertiliser on al Qaida s ground The director of UNRWA operations in Gaza Ging gave a speech in London this week entitled Illegal inhuman and insane a medieval siege on Gaza in This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to How has Israel the only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end come to risk any claim to international legitimacy in its handling of this situation Hamas are the enemy of Israel but they do not have to be They preach violent resistance too readily yet over the past months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets imperfectly perhaps but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed alas one immigrant worker was by a rocket since the Gaza bombing stopped in They are also the implacable opponents of al Qaida They won a fair election in and claim to respect democracy Let s test them on that At present Hamas security people are being sniped at by the Israeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups This is genuinely getting insane The unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine in both the West Bank and Gaza is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation I am convinced from my own direct experience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the threat of violence and that they would enter in good faith if that were reciprocated negotiations to establish two states in the disputed territories Israel and Palestine with their own rights and responsibilities under international law The distortion of their position a little of it the fault of their own PR does no side any good If a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now what about a first step I believe an arrangement to end the blockade is within reach if only Israel Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue Hamas have indicated that they could cease all attacks on Israeli soil close the tunnels release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms Gaza if the blockade was ended an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt The Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation while the relationship between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad But the UN the US Russia the EU and the Arab world must make a much more serious attempt to test the possibilities putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first not their own political comfort We are coming close to losing the chance of a two state solution US policy based on a West Bank only approach is locked in a cul de sac if Gaza is left out of the equation because majority Palestinian support will be lacking Israel is confident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated But that ignores the huge danger of losing the political diplomatic legal and moral high ground This matters in today s world as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq because government authority and public opinion interact closely and legitimacy breeds support Israel s relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond the west That now lies in tatters If Israel is left as the permanent occupier or controlling a one state structure with part of its population downgraded or imprisoned it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for I hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel s discomfiture They have so far for a political organisation attracted much too narrow a range of international support If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner they must unequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet the cessation of violence underline that their objective is a two state settlement and win international friends for the ending of the occupation In whoever s hands bombs bullets rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing But a push for justice will This article was originally written for the Times but not published

3520,Sad news,Ryan Mcnamara Corrine Delano Omorinsola Claps Boys home closing but numbers don t tell full story By Burt Constable I Daily Herald Columnist Published AM When the goal is turning around lives of young abused and neglected boys filling out the scoresheet is more complicated than simply marking wins or losses For the past years Ann G Deuel has lived in Arlington Heights but her heart has resided in Jamal Place a three story graystone at S California Ave in the North Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago As a founder and executive director of Jamal Place Deuel can tell countless stories about the boys ages to who have spent time in the group home and about the army of suburbanites from St Charles Naperville Lake Zurich and Lisle who have volunteered donated and served on the board to help those kids Lots of people in that field have good things to say about Deuel and Jamal Place But when the new fiscal year begins on the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services will not renew its contract with Jamal Place forcing those kids to go to other facilities To shut us down and deny kids this opportunity is unconscionable says Deuel as she takes a deep breath and dabs at her eyes in an attempt to keep her emotions in check She and her staff operated last year through a contract with DCFS to provide a group home for wards of the state They ve carved out a wonderful reputation in years so what happened The easy answer is that DCFS put the group home under a new performance based contracting system that determined Jamal Place fell short of benchmarks for keeping kids from running away requiring hospitalization or ending up in juvenile detention Taxpayers expect and deserve positive results in the children we serve says DCFS spokesman Kendall Marlowe Jamal Place simply didn t measure up in the areas the state measures Because Illinois has trimmed the number of wards of the state from a high of in to only a much higher percentage of those kids have mental illnesses substance abuse or other problems Since the state measures an agency s performance by days that the kids are physically present in the home Jamal Place with its small population got bad marks when a child was hospitalized for a mental health issue or detained by a judge We did what was clinically advisable for these children and we got dinged for it says Brian Barclay assistant executive director of Jamal Place We did what was in kids best interest There is no consideration given for incremental improvements in youth behavior which occur as trusting relationships develop Deuel notes I wish they could find a way to measure the individual aspects When compared with similar facilities Jamal Place graded lower Marlowe says adding that it isn t a happy day when the state ends an agreement with a facility that has good people and has done good work in the past He says DCFS did renew a contract with Deuel for a different transitional living facility that serves an older population One of Jamal Place s unfavorable outcomes involves a kid who already had a criminal record when he came to the group home at age Now he says he ended up in juvenile court after he made a mistake by hanging with the wrong people on the day when he stole a woman s purse I ve got a good relationship with the staff and residents We did things as a family says the teen who now is living with a grandmother I love my grandmother but I d rather be at Jamal Place I m trying to do everything in my power to get back to Jamal Place Intangibles aren t part of the bureaucratic process There isn t a place on an evaluation form to give credit to Deuel and her staff for leading the effort that closed a local crack house There s no way to measure the improvements in a former resident that led him for the first time to sign love before his name on the Mother s Day card he sent Deuel this year There s no scoresheet for the local gang leader who stopped preying on Jamal kids when he was confronted by Deuel and recognized her as the woman who gave him a Christmas present a few years earlier The interview for this story is interrupted when that man calls Deuel who is helping him find a legitimate job It is enormously frustrating to me that the attachment the boys develop with our staff members is not a measurable outcome Deuel says These are our children Long after DCFS is done with these kids our door is still open Last weekend many former residents came back to explain how Jamal Place helped them On Jamal Place will celebrate its th anniversary with a picnic and walkathon in Douglas Park across the street from the home Deuel and her staff are hoping DCFS finds a way to give them more time another year to continue its mission I ve always maintained that God won t let us fail says Deuel For years that s been the case and now we ve got this challenge

3582,Mother Teresa,Just FYI on the below from one of those crazy right magazines notes that the home you referenced in your Prayer Breakfast remarks has since closed I checked in with they didn t know it closed which makes sense since it happened in after you left the White House I made it clear that your longtime commitment to this issue throughout your public career is well known and you remain very proud of your work with Mother Teresa in opening this home in And that your partnership is a success story to be emulated Again this is just FYI http www worldmag com webextra ADOPTION I Hillary Clinton continues to hail an adoption home she helped open with Mother Teresa that has since closed its doors By Emily Belz WASHINGTON An adoption ministry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed as a home she helped open with Mother Teresa no longer handles adoptions and its phone line has been disconnected though at last week s National Prayer Breakfast Clinton spent five minutes of her minute speech relating the story of its opening Last Clinton described Mother Teresa beaming about what this meant for children and their futures seemingly oblivious that the Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington D C is now defunct She said she worked tirelessly to cut through all the red tape although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing According to a pastor at the church next door to the home s former location the adoption ministry failed to take off because the Roman Catholic nuns who ran it weren t allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site I m not sure the legal thing that came down upon them but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way said Maureen Freshour who along with her husband pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby Freshour has stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining three or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington where they are ministering to the homeless This has been a core issue adoption whether the home Clinton talked about survived or not said Chuck Johnson chief operating officer of the National Council for Adoption It s an issue she s been consistent on During her speech on Clinton reminisced about the National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother Teresa was the speaker The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion saying Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love but to use any violence to get what they want Mother Teresa then called on attendees to fight abortion through adoption Please don t kill the child I want the child Please give me the child The audience that day gave her a standing ovation but President and Mrs Clinton both pro abortion did not stand Afterward Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage sitting on folding chairs Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter She told me that she knew that we had a shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies Clinton related last And she asked me or more properly she directed me to work with her to create a home for such babies here in Washington Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy The Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children opened in in the district s affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant mothers and their babies but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions I called the Missionaries of Charity in Washington a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa The nun who answered the phone said she couldn t give her name because they aren t allowed to talk to the press She did say however that the sisters who are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened so she wasn t sure why it closed She added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in We work with the poor and we didn t have any work there because it s a rich neighborhood she said The sisters she added are now working with the homeless and those with AIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street

3594,FT,Our clips service doesn t have the license necessary to provide FT or Reuters content so here s the long awaited FT profile you ll be especially interested in the guest column Milliband wrote An FT interview with Hillary Clinton By Dombey FT This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton The motorcade twisting and skidding through rain splashed streets for more than an hour the public meetings and camera lights at journey s end the spotlight that has not let up for two decades It is almost as if the US presidential election hailed as the most exciting for a generation had never ended But this is a campaign without a vote Today Clinton s convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo Brazil not South Hampton New Hampshire She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House despite what the overnight flights town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might suggest Instead she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of US leadership one very much built around herself She s had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the odd students and staff crammed the hall tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares an Afro Brazilian university but she s still greeted by a wave of raised arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones In the convoy moments before she was wrapped in a shawl suffering from a cold and angry at the delays that pushed us the side streets speckled with box like bars warehouses and love hotels while Brazilian motorists sought to cut our path There is no sign of that now With the metabolism of a born politician she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students teachers and local celebrities for an hour Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage Most US secretaries of state wouldn t bother with this sort of event much less initiate it and arrange for it to be screened on the biggest local channel Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip and she seems to spend half her life on her official crammed with long time aides and armed bodyguards The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting She has notched up more than a quarter of a million miles since taking office On this Latin America trip thrown confusion by an earthquake in Chile we have already visited four countries in hours We go to tiny Uruguay where our stay is so brief we check a hotel just for a shower Argentina where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace Chile itself where we don t leave the airport and Brazil where we spend almost a full day So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never ending world tour Travelling with her for a week talking to people inside and outside the administration I tried to find out We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister or the foreign minister or an ambassador she tells me a few weeks later as she perches on a sofa in her expansive office with its view of the Lincoln Memorial People now have a voice and an opinion and a vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take I want to model a different kind of leadership that is open and willing to listen but also to stand our ground if necessary She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US s image in the wake of the Bush administration by making contact with public opinion abroad and so boosting American power Her aides say that as a battle hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world she is ideally placed to carry out the task But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama her boss and former rival or whether her role and ambitions go beyond that Is she a kind of saleswoman in chief for the US I ask Well I think that is part of the job she replies toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water If you are making a case for American values and for American leadership you have to make it where people now get information Given the bridges we had to build and some of the repair work we had to do we had to travel As in S ao Paulo her system is under strain I ve been fighting this all day she says as she masks a cough set off by her allergies Washington s cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers Life is still hectic the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State Department are showing the first British election debate But Clinton remains enthusiastic affable and unhurried her speech peppered with exclamations such as oh my gosh even as she discusses issues of state She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe s airspace shutdown and tells me she s been talking to Norway s foreign minister about it He said that this dust gets engines of any size even Air Force One it s chunky I don t know how else to describe it she says an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word chunky Clinton often speaks in this eager unvarnished way a world away from the clipped on message manner of her immediate predecessor in the post Condoleezza If anything she is an undiplomat known less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes a woman who retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying from a room Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in years to have served as secretary of state and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since Baker H W Bush s right hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor She may be the most substantive politician in the office since Jennings Bryan the three time presidential candidate who served as secretary almost a century ago Her stature on the world stage her almost presidential stature has set her apart Bill the top career diplomat at the State Department tells me Leaders want to meet her And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S ao Paulo airport in Back in Sao Paulo the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of traditional diplomacy Annie a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair tells Clinton about her dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees A nervous young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy Clinton smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers bears with him all the same Another female student asks for an autograph When answering Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she emphasises a phrase at other moments seemingly at random she pulls her hands apart as if demonstrating the size of a fish Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion which is illegal in Brazil and Clinton moves treacherous terrain She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the s that treated not just expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions Wealthy women have rights in every country she says And poor women don t Her strength of feeling can t be hidden as she denounces the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise such a fundamental personal right Tom the US ambassador to Brazil tells me later I understand the possible concern that we might have come close to domestic issues But she wasn t laying out a prescription for Brazil She was sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state It s true Clinton doesn t quite cross the line Onstage she is controlled without seeming artificial convivial without appearing over effusive what a previous age would call a real trouper At the podium she looks straight ahead her lips carefully expressionless Still the old competitive instincts haven t left her Perhaps it is the lecterns at press conferences reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates but on exiting the podium at a joint appearance with Argentina s president Cristina Fernandez Clinton makes clear her satisfaction at having had the last word The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the stage Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her almost inhuman loyalty towards Obama Her mastery of the facts an information carnivore one of her officials calls her comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed rather than helping frame it herself In Sao Paulo she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive discrimination another sensitive topic in Brazil not least because Clinton herself observes Afro Brazilians account for more than half the country s population but only per cent of university students That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken in recruiting and admitting students so that they can have a chance to succeed she tells the hall again inching towards domestic politics before speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half century She says The election of Barack Obama many believe was the greatest accomplishment of all because it demonstrated that an African American could be elected president of the United States Among the crowd I catch my breath and scribble down her words It s hard to think of a more fulsome statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama and who squandered a huge poll lead and millions of dollars in the struggle against him The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama administration When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the obedience of office she dismisses my question with an anodyne that s politics She adds We re working really hard and well together It just never comes up any more it seems like ancient history to me Not so ancient I think that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign I always run inclusive and successful organisations she retorts when I ask her whether she d applied any lessons from that searing experience to her new post She admits she didn t want the job at State she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the Senate but at the end of the day I m pretty old fashioned and if the president asks you to do something you d better have a really good reason why you can t Also she adds Suppose I had won and I were asking him to be in my cabinet I would have wanted him to say yes Others say the relationship is more complex that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work Clinton has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than before Quite simply she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised that says Anne Marie head of the State Department policy planning unit The relationship is based on her performance in the job By all accounts it s a collaborative partnership though not perhaps a warm one Clinton boasts a good working relationship with the main players of the administration and has formed something of an alliance with defence secretary Gates although on life and death issues such as Afghanistan it is Gates not her who has taken the lead As one official told me secretaries of state have often either been popular with their own department comes to mind or with the rest of the administration as was Condoleezza but Clinton has managed to be both In truth Clinton s language remains harder edged than Obama s she recently claimed that Iran s Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow motion coup and she has sometimes been more willing than he is to hint at using the military She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time says Volker a US ambassador to Nato under W Bush She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama Meanwhile she has been careful to keep her husband the former US president in the background Aides say they have barely seen him in the building though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill Clinton gives her strategic advice One of his favourite sayings that I remind myself of all the time is a kind of baseball saying she says Don t major in the minors keep your eye on not just the headlines but the trend lines It is her co operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the chief theme of her time so far at State When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office she replies the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying and solving problems A more process oriented less provocative answer would be hard to imagine But maybe I think the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus style Clinton herself suggests that so formidable are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter internecine fights but needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand Whatever the reason for her stance it seems to be a smart decision by all accounts she s overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had towards her It s fair to say that she was not born the administration s inner circle but slowly but surely for the most consequential decisions she now has a prime seat at the table says one official Praising what he calls her Terminator quality durability and determination he adds She s done an amazing amount of work judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up by mastering the details Indeed Clinton s ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building She has dropped obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details At her confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator at the meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US She herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle despite her campaign claims of expertise in the field It was so intellectually challenging just to get our arms around all of these issues she says During her first year she was criticised for apparent gaffes including the way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze a few months later as unprecedented On an election campaign she says you may be in a different city four times a day but you have a message you re trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your audience But here you might deal with different countries problems six different regional or global challenges in the course of a day As the Latin America tour shows she is now trying to do both travel incessantly and solve an array of international issues She is at the forefront of the US s efforts to consolidate relations with a number of important countries predominantly Russia and China but also rising powers such as Brazil Turkey Indonesia and South Africa and to cool down anti American feeling in hotspots notably Pakistan She says the push is working hailing a change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the US a reference to Russia and Pakistan But it is far from smooth sailing Differences about Iran and over Israel s raid on aid bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently amid questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration s policies During my time with her on the road the stop in Brazil is the focal point not surprising given the country s increased profile as Latin America leader Clinton is now heading the administration s push to secure sanctions on Iran and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her cause She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim Brazil s foreign minister At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation as she denounces an Iran that runs to Brazil as well as other countries such as Turkey and China telling different things to different people to avoid international sanctions Amorim is spiky in his own way drawing parallels to the s sanctions on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the war Of course I don t agree with everything the Secretary said he says It is not a happy experience indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the United Nations yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up Years ago one of Bill Clinton s biographers described his approach to government as a permanent campaign and it appears to be his wife s preferred form of existence as well If there is one constant in Clinton s life it is that she never throws in her cards whether what motivates her is power or public service Never never she exclaims when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off the wings after the frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House I have a very realistic sense of what high stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it s shocking when you are in the arena but once you figure it out you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding but you can t take it personally Such treatment seems to rankle all the same She s been listening to coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders wives Whether a woman s running for office or she s supporting her husband who s running for office and she gets criticised for wearing open toed shoes or for the colour of her coat there s just a lot of history that you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena she says Another country Clinton boards her official to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job as in her many other incarnations in American public life whether as First Lady or before I feel passionately it is in not just the American national security interests but the world s that women be given the opportunities and the tools to make the most out of their own lives she says In the s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated Today she says I certainly don t read coverage of me I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do my job It s all baloney says her press adviser who set up the meeting with her and is sitting to one side in her office Yeah yeah right that s what he tells me Clinton responds I wonder She may not read the stories about her but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by talking to American magazines such as Esquire Vogue and Parade To what end Clinton has said she will only serve one four year term as secretary of state understandable given the grind of the job When I ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so she responds I d love that obviously I would love that I want to be front and centre when it happens Any chance it would be you I ask No no I don t think that s in the cards Clinton says She s given more categoric denials in the past I think that there s a whole generation of young women and not so young but mature seasoned women who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there It is not for the faint of heart to run for president and I believe it is harder for women it just is and that s just a fact But says one US official all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with electoral politics Why do all this stuff She s already Hillary Clinton You have to ask What s the idea behind raising her domestic profile still further Indeed she is now by some counts the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say she could be a good fit for the vice presidential slot in the elections Back in Sao Paulo once the town hall meeting is over Clinton faces a seven hour flight to Costa Rica The journey goes on and on and as saleswoman in chief for the US in an unruly world she faces a long hard road Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage But the obstacles are rather fewer if the product she is pitching is herself A secretary of state like none before her Hillary Clinton long one of the most formidable figures in US politics is looking stronger than ever Dombey is the FT s US diplomatic correspondent Miliband Hillary is a rock star she has a great sense of fun and a great sense of humour It s too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration is laying the foundations for long term change in America s foreign policy The challenges are immense probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration But American leadership is essential and a commitment to multilateralism in fact multi multilateralism using different and overlapping forums is real and right You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers meeting in it was a nice surprise that all the staff never mind the press seemed to have turned out in droves for my arrival Then I realised that Hillary was minutes behind me That said the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her hard work all of which are well known but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great sense of fun and a great sense of humour She has seen politics from all sides and can laugh at herself as well as at others She s a remarkably good listener always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own She thinks strategically as well as tactically She s also very very unpompous Hillary is a very political person but in a particular way she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a necessary evil but a calling of value and vocation She knows you win some and you lose some but it s essential to take part There s one other thing Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the people she s dealing with Their motivation their loyalties their culture It s real emotional intelligence in trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree I think that must be why so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague Miliband is shadow foreign secretary Gideon Rachman Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly close A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton s stint as secretary of state would have to give her for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements maybe a six or a seven Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria First how have they done in the endless bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics Second how effective have they been in promoting US foreign policy in the wider world Success in one area usually helps in the other Henry Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter and his close relationship with President Nixon made him all the more effective overseas W Bush s first secretary of state was widely admired outside the US but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles which limited his ability to get things done in the wider world Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked the debilitating Washington struggles that so damaged Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the campaign Clinton has a good working relationship with the president But while relations between the White House and the State Department are cordial they do not seem to be particularly close Clinton appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department with the result that State is rather detached from Obama s inner circle Obama s penchant for making high profile speeches in foreign capitals such as Cairo Prague Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than anyone else to define his administration s approach to the world That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy But special representatives have been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East and the Treasury is critical to China policy Asked about Clinton s impact as secretary of state one senior European policymaker purses his lips and says She s done some great trips and she s highly professional But it s hard to see any particular area where she has really driven policy Gideon Rachman is the FT s chief foreign affairs columnist Rothkopf When she has been asked to deliver tough messages she has done so unflinchingly Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state she has protected the president well and pursued his agenda without upstaging him an early concern given her stature She has worked very well with other members of the cabinet and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy structure accordingly An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co operating with private and non state actors such as NG s as well as dealing with non state threats When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages she has done so unflinchingly This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing Still neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation The US may be the most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries and many aspects of the situation we face today are beyond our control The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely difficult hand not only Iraq and Afghanistan but Iran and North Korea s nuclear programmes the rise of emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to one where the limits are clear from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to work in the context of the G a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role All of those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation The next step is to identify a couple of signature issues and have a couple of signature successes That will take her to the next level Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with expertise in national security

in Afghanistan slam Obama report mins ago WASHINGTON Reuters Aides to the top U S general in Afghanistan insulted some of President Barack Obama s closest advisers calling one a clown and another a wounded animal in an article to be published in Rolling Stone magazine The article also quotes an aide describing the commander of U S and NATO forces in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal s disappointment with his initial one on one meeting with Obama last year Quoting all the McChrystal aides anonymously the article portrays a split between the U S military and Obama s advisers at an extremely sensitive moment for the Pentagon which is fending off criticism of its strategy to turn around the nearly nine year old Afghan war The Pentagon had no immediate comment about the article which has been brought to the attention of senior officials It quotes a member of McChrystal s team making jokes about Vice President Joe Biden who was seen as critical of the general s efforts to escalate the conflict and who had favored a more limited counter terrorism approach Biden the aide was quoted as saying Did you say Bite me Another aide called White House National Security Adviser Jim a retired four star general a clown who was stuck in It quoted an adviser to McChrystal dismissing an early meeting with Obama as a minute photo op Obama clearly didn t know anything about him who he was The boss was pretty disappointed the adviser told the magazine McChrystal a famous workaholic said to sleep just four hours a day was brought Afghanistan a year ago after his predecessor was pushed out The article portrays his teams as disapproving of the Obama administration with the exception of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who backed McCrystal s request for additional troops in Afghanistan Some of the strongest criticism was reserved for Obama s special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan The boss says he s like a wounded animal a member of the general s team is quoted as saying keeps hearing rumors that he s going to get fired so that makes him dangerous McChrystal was quoted as saying he felt betrayed by the leak of a classified cable from U S Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry last year The cable raised doubts about sending more troops to shore up an Afghan government already lacking in credibility I like Karl I ve known him for years but they d never said anything like that to us before McChrystal was quoted as saying in the article Here s one that covers his flank for the history books Now if we fail they can say I told you so Editing by Washington World Desk Copyright Yahoo Inc All rights reserved And from the WSJ JUNE PM ET McChrystal s Next Offensive Relations between the U S military and civilians in the Obama administration have been tense since last year s three month review of Afghan war strategy a state of affairs unlikely to be helped by a new profile of Gen Stanley McChrystal the overall commander in Afghanistan that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on In the eight page article released to reporters on ahead of publication McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and accuses Karl Eikenberry the U S ambassador to Kabul of undermining his war plan within the administration Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall fewer troops more drone attacks the article reports that McChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one liner to dismiss the question Are you asking about Vice President Biden McChrystal reportedly jokes Who s that Later in the article McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry The cables called question the major troop increase advocated by McChrystal s team and the U S s backing of Afghan President Hamid Karzai views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff I like Karl I ve known him for years but they d never said anything like that to us before McChrystal is quoted as saying Here s one that covers his flank for the history books Now if we fail they can say I told you so The article titled The Runaway General has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a top commander in hot water an cover story in Esquire hop wvav esquire com features fox fallon on Adm Fox Fallon then commander of all U S forces in the Middle East and Central Asia The article eventually played a part in Fallon s resignation two years ago In that Esquire piece however Fallon appeared to directly contradict White House policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East the Rolling Stone article makes no such allegation but rather is full of jokey put downs of important Washington players Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration including National Security Adviser and other leading politicians like Sens Kerry D Mass and McCain R Ariz They also make some unflattering references to PresidentBarack Obama himself saying the president didn t seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year Only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal s plan for Afghanistan is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystal aides A spokesman for McChrystal did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Copyright Dow Company Inc All

Biden report AFP hour ago WASHINGTON The US commander in Afghanistan mocks the vice president and denounces a top diplomat in a magazine interview while his aides speak dismissively of President Barack Obama Tensions between General Stanley McChrystal and the White House are on full display in an unflattering profile in Rolling Stone of the commander of US and NATO forces in the Afghan war McChrystal jokes sarcastically about preparing to answer a question referring to Vice President Joe Biden known as a skeptic of the commander s war strategy Are you asking about Vice President Biden McChrystal says with a laugh Who s that the article quotes him as saying Biden suggests a top adviser Did you say Bite Me McChrystal tells the magazine that he felt betrayed by the US ambassador to Kabul Karl Eikenberry in a White House debate over war strategy last year Referring to a leaked internal memo from Eikenberry that questioned McChrystal s request for more troops the commander suggested the ambassador had tried to protect himself for history s sake I like Karl I ve known him for years but they d never said anything like that to us before McChrystal tells the magazine Here s one that covers his flank for the history books Now if we fail they can say I told you so Eikenberry himself a former commander in Afghanisan had written to the White House saying Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an unreliable partner and that a surge of troops could draw the United States a open ended quagmire The article revisits the friction between the White House and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystal s request for tens of thousands of reinforcements Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for the strategy review was a difficult time the general tells the magazine I found that time painful McChrystal says I was selling an unsellable position An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago just after the president named him to take over in Afghanistan It was a minute photo op the general s adviser says Obama clearly didn t know anything about him who he was he didn t seem very engaged The boss was pretty disappointed says the adviser The profile titled The Runaway General portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal while arguing the general has seized control over the war on the military and diplomatic fronts The four star general also derides the hard charging top US envoy to the region and complains about a dinner with an unnamed French minister during a visit to Paris Oh not another e mail from McChrystal says looking at his messages on a mobile phone I don t even want to open it In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official McChrystal says How d I get screwed going to this dinner The dinner comes with the position sir says his aide Colonel Charlie Flynn Hey Charlie McChrystal says does this come with the position McChrystal gives him the middle finger Copyright AFP All rights reserved

3617,Max from Israel: deconstruction of propaganda and media,http maxblumenthal com the israeli medias flotilla fail The Israeli Media s Flotilla Fail On By Max My summaty of the Israeli media s shambolic performance following the flotilla massacre was originally published here in Hebrew at Dvorit Shargal s excellent Israeli media blog Velvet Underground The English version follows If the raid of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a disaster for the Israel Defense Forces its aftermath demonstrated an equally bewildering performance by the Israeli media The IDF Spokesman s Office churned out one misleading claim after another each one more implausible than the next seeking to implant in the public s mind a version of events that bore little relation to reality To a degree this was to be expected but it was startling to see how some of Israel s most respected reporters lined up to serve as military stenographers barely challenging the IDF s rapidly changing versions of events IDF claims about the flotilla passengers links to Al Qaida anti Semitic statements shouted at the Israeli Navy and their terrorist intentions were eagerly broadcast by the Israeli media without a second thought When independent reporters forced the IDF to retract or clarify all of these claims Israeli news outlets refused to correct their errors or covered them up without acknowledgment It so happened that I arrived in Israel for a research trip the day after the flotilla raid As a result I was able to do something which I always thought to be a very basic journalistic practice so basic it s supposed to be applied routinely Asking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims What I found bewildering is that at least judging from Israeli media reports few if any mainstream reporters applied this practice and when a visiting colleague did their job for them nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report On the IDF disseminated a press release entitled Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaeda mercenaries The accusation was not accompanied by any conclusive evidence the IDF reported that Mavi Marmara passengers were equipped with night vision goggles gasp This did not stop Yedioth s Ron Ben Yishai who was embedded with the Navy commandos from amplifying the baseless charge Citing an interrogation of Marmara passengers lynchers he called them Ben Yishai wrote the same day Some among the flotilla passengers are believed to have ties with World Jihad groups mainly Al Qaeda The article made no reference to any efforts on part of Ben Yishai to investigate this claim nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerous operatives of Osama Bin Laden presumably they would attack again wouldn t they On Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the Real News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesman s Office to demand further evidence of the Marmara s Al Qaeda ties We received identical responses from spokespeople from the IDF s Israel and North America desks We don t have any evidence The press release was based on information from the National Security Council Hours later the IDF retracted its claim changing the title of its press release to Attackers of IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers Despite the official retraction Ben Yishai s article remains uncorrected On the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Naval warship Go back to Aushwitz a Marmara passenger shouted according to the IDF YNet and Haaretz reported on and reproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity Forget that the voice uttering the anti Semitic slur sounded like a mentally disturbed teenager had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman s Office website they would have found a longer clip released on that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara with no mention of Auschwitz Further the voice of flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf was featured in the Aushwitz clip yet Arraf was not aboard the Marmara she was on the Challenger One Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit public hysteria surrounding the issue of anti Semitism On my blog I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF s footage and raised the question of doctoring The next day the IDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage releasing a clarification and a new clip claiming to consist of the full exchange between the Navy and the flotilla Unfortunately the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify Despite the IDF s admission YNet and Haaretz have not corrected their original reports though Haaretz has at least altered its headline Once the doctoring was exposed the New York Times covered the episode in detail directing international attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel s parochial press corps On Haaretz s Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotilla passengers had links to international terror The press release was larded with highly implausible claims including that Ken O Keefe who runs an aid organization with Tony s sister in law was planning to train a Hamas commando unit in the Gaza Strip When I called the IDF Spokesman s Office I learned that once again no evidence was available to support their press release There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case Sgt Chen Arad told me Obviously I m unable to give you more information Did Pfeffer demand more evidence If he did and was answered in the same manner as I did why did Haaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact Joined by Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos Harel Pfeffer became a channel for another daytime deception by the IDF On the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Naval commandos the flotilla passengers side of the story was ignored claiming they had faced live fire and lynching attempts from Marmara passengers Since the story was published the IDF has produced scant evidence to support either accusation The article was accompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesman s Office depicting a bearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists Daylight beamed in from a window behind the man Haaretz s caption which was sourced to the IDF asserted that the photo was taken after the commandos had boarded the Marmara However the commandos raided the ship at night while the photo was taken during the day Once again the IDF s story was fishy I called Sgt Arad at the IDF Spokesman s Office to investigate He told me he had no evidence to support the photo s questionable caption Soon after our phone conversation Haaretz quietly altered the caption removing its claim that the photo was taken after the commando raid For nearly a week the false photo caption had remained intact Why did Haaretz suddenly change it The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesman s Office If true the tip off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the country s media In the wake of the flotilla raid Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global media s investigation the bloodbath that occurred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara After all no one had better access to the military or the eyewitnesses aboard the flotilla Instead too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscripted the IDF s hapless information war leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters who remembered to view claims by any nation s military with extreme skepticism So why do well connected experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly and fail to follow up when IDF claims are retracted Is it simple bias a desire to present their military in the best possible light a desire so strong they abandon their duty to their readers to verify their information Are they afraid of sanctions of losing contacts and access to information Do they fear personal reprisals Their readers and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as a vital source of information need to know

3625,H: The bigger story here is the internal revolt against McChrystal. Sid,The Runaway General Stanley McChrystal Obama s top commander in Afghanistan has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the real enemy The wimps in the White House By Hastings Jun AM EDT This article originally appeared in RS from Howed I get screwed going to this dinner demands Gen Stanley McChrystal It s a night in mid and the commander of all U S and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four star suite at the HOtel Westminster in Paris He s in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies to keep up the fiction in essence that we actually have allies Since McChrystal took over a year ago the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United States Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government forced the resignation of Germany s president and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their troops McChrystal is in Paris to keep the French who have lost more than soldiers in Afghanistan from going all wobbly on him The dinner comes with the position sir says his chief of staff Col Charlie Flynn McChrystal turns sharply in his chair Hey Charlie he asks does this come with the position McChrystal gives him the middle finger The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of has converted a full scale operations center The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks and blue cables crisscross the hotel s thick carpet hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e mail communications Dressed in off the rack civilian casual blue tie button down shirt dress slacks McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone Paris as one of his advisers says is the most anti McChrystal city you can imagine The general hates fancy restaurants rejecting any place with candles on the tables as too Gucci He prefers Bud Light Lime his favorite beer to Bordeaux Talladega Nights his favorite movie to Jean Luc Godard Besides the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt comfortable Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan he spent five years running the Pentagon s most secretive black ops What s the update on the Kandahar bombing McChrystal asks Flynn The city has been rocked by two massive car bombs in the past day alone calling question the general s assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban We have two KIAs but that hasn t been confirmed Flynn says McChrystal takes a final look around the suite At he is gaunt and lean not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in Rescue Dawn His slate blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you If you ve fucked up or disappointed him they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice I d rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner McChrystal says He pauses a beat Unfortunately he adds no one in this room could do it With that he s out the door Who s he going to dinner with I ask one of his aides Some French minister the aide tells me It s fucking gay The next morning McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire a French military academy The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else but his brashness comes with a price Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year in that short time he has managed to piss off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict Last fall during the question and answer session following a speech he gave in London McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as shortsighted saying it would lead to a state of Chaos istan The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president himself who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One The message to McChrystal seemed clear Shut the fuck up and keep a lower profile Now flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get today and how he should respond I never know what s going to pop out until I m up there that s the problem he says Then unable to help themselves he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one liner Are you asking about Vice President Biden McChrystal says with a laugh Who s that Biden suggests a top adviser Did you say Bite Me When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign promise on foreign policy to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place I want the American people to understand he announced in We have a clear and focused goal to disrupt dismantle and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan He ordered another troops to Kabul the largest increase since the war began in Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff he also fired Gen McKiernan then the U S and NATO commander in Afghanistan and replaced him with a man he didn t know and had met only briefly Gen Stanley McChrystal It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in more than years since Harry Truman fired Gen Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War Even though he had voted for Obama McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect The general first encountered Obama a week after he took office when the president met with a dozen senior military officials in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank According to sources familiar with the meeting McChrystal thought Obama looked uncomfortable and intimidated by the roomful of military brass Their first one on one meeting took place in the Oval Office four months later after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job and it didn t go much better It was a minute photo op says an adviser to McChrystal Obama clearly didn t know anything about him who he was Here s the guy who s going to run his fucking war but he didn t seem very engaged The Boss was pretty disappointed From the start McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan to use it as a laboratory for a controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency COIN as the theory is known is the new gospel of the Pentagon brass a doctrine that attempts to square the military s preference for high tech violence with the demands of fighting protracted wars in failed states COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the enemy but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild or build from scratch another nation s government a process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years if not decades to achieve The theory essentially rebrands the military expanding its authority and its funding to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps In after Gen Petraeus beta tested the theory during his surge in Iraq it quickly gained a hardcore following of think tankers journalists military officers and civilian officials Nicknamed COINdinistas for their cultish zeal this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution for Afghanistan All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists in Iraq Figure out how your enemy operates be faster and more ruthless than everybody else then take the fuckers out After arriving in Afghanistan last the general conducted his own policy review ordered up by Defense Secretary Gates The now infamous report was leaked to the press and its conclusion was dire If we didn t send another troops swelling the number of U S forces in Afghanistan by nearly half we were in danger of mission failure The White House was furious McChrystal they felt was trying to bully Obama opening him up to charges of being weak on national security unless he did what the general wanted It was Obama versus the Pentagon and the Pentagon was determined to kick the president s ass Last fall with his top general calling for more troops Obama launched a three month review to re evaluate the strategy in Afghanistan I found that time painful McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews I was selling an unsellable position For the general it was a crash course in Beltway politics a battle that pitted him against experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan would plunge America a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks The entire COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people says Douglas Macgregor a retired colonel and leading critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal The idea that we are going to spend a trillion dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense In the end however McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted On st in a speech at West Point the president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea It s expensive we re in an economic crisis a decade long commitment would sap American power Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan Then without ever using the words victory or win Obama announced that he would send an additional troops to Afghanistan almost as many as McChrystal had requested The president had thrown his weight however hesitantly behind the counterinsurgency crowd Today as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan the prospects for any kind of success look bleak In the death toll for U S troops passed and the number of IEDs has doubled Spending hundreds of billions of dollars on the fifth poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population whose attitude toward U S troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile Thetiggest military operation of the year a ferocious offensive that began in to retake the southern town of Marja continues to drag on prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it as a bleeding ulcer In Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history and Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U S troops in of next year The president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire a quagmire he knowingly walked even though it s precisely the kind of gigantic mind numbing multigenerational nation building project he explicitly said he didn t want Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to accomplish in Afghanistan it s going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm It s not going to look like a win smell like a win or taste like a win says Maj Gen Bill Mayville who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal This is going to end in an argument The night after his speech in Paris McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O Shea s an Irish pub catering to tourists around the corner from the hotel His wife Annie has joined him for a rare visit Since the Iraq War began in she has seen her husband less than days a year Though it is his and Annie s rd wedding anniversary McChrystal has invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the least Gucci place his staff could find His wife isn t surprised He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear she says with a laugh The general s staff is a handpicked collection of killers spies geniuses patriots political operators and outright maniacs There s a former head of British Forces two Navy Seals an Afghan Forces commando a lawyer two fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts They jokingly refer to themselves as Team America taking the name from the South Park esque sendup of military cluelessness and they pride themselves on their can do attitude and their disdain for authority After arriving in Kabul last summer Team America set about changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force as the NATO led mission is known U S soldiers had taken to deriding ISAF as short for I Suck at Fighting or In Sandals and Flip Flops McChrystal banned alcohol on base kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess expanded the morning briefing to include thousands of officers and refashioned the command center a Situational Awareness Room a free flowing information hub modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg s offices in New York He also set a manic pace for his staff becoming legendary for sleeping four hours a night running seven miles each morning and eating one meal a day In the month I spend around the general I witness him eating only once It s a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him a staple in almost every media profile as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates the possibility of a man single handedly winning the war By midnight at Kitty O Shea s much of Team America is completely shitfaced Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps from a traditional Afghan wedding dance while McChrystal s top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own invention Afghanistan they bellow Afghanistan They call it their Afghanistan song McChrystal steps away from the circle observing his team All these men he tells me I d die for them And they d die for me The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam but in fact this tight knit group represents the most powerful force shaping U S policy in Afghanistan While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable command of all military aspects of the war there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side Instead an assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio U S Ambassador Karl Eikenberry to Afghanistan National Security Advisor Jim and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not to mention or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves the mess from Kerry to McCain This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal s team to call the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan It jeopardizes the mission says Stephen Biddle a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal The military cannot by itself create governance reform Part of the problem is structural The Defense Department budget exceeds billion a year while the State Department receives only billion But part of the problem is personal In private Team McChrystal likes to talk shit about many of Obama s top people on the diplomatic side One aide calls Jim a retired four star general and veteran of the Cold War a clown who remains stuck in Politicians like McCain and Kerry says another aide turn up have a meeting with Karzai criticize him at the airport press conference then get back for the talk shows Frankly it s not very helpful Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal s inner circle Hillary had Stan s back during the strategic review says an adviser She said If Stan wants it give him what he needs McChrystal reserves special skepticism for the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban The Boss says he s like a wounded animal says a member of the general s team keeps hearing rumors that he s going to get fired so that makes him dangerous He s a brilliant guy but he just comes in pulls on a lever whatever he can grasp onto But this is COIN and you can t just have someone yanking on shit At one point on his trip to Paris McChrystal checks his BlackBerry Oh not another e mail from he groans I don t even want to open it He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud then stuffs the BladkBerry back in his pocket not bothering to conceal his annoyance Make sure you don t get any of that on your leg an aide jokes referring to the e mail By far the most crucial and strained relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry the U S ambassador According to those close to the two men Eikenberry a retired three star general who served in Afghanistan in and can t stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots He s also furious that McChrystal backed by NATO s allies refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan which would have made him the diplomatic equivalent of the general The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill a move that effectively increased McChrystal s influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival In reality that position needs to be filled by an American for it to have weight says a U S official familiar with the negotiations The relationship was further strained in when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New York Times The cable was as scathing as it was prescient The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal s strategy dismissed President Hamid Karzai as not an adequate strategic partner and cast doubt on whether the counterinsurgency plan would be sufficient to deal with Al Qaeda We will become more deeply engaged here with no way to extricate ourselves Eikenberry warned short of allowing the country to descend again lawlessness and chaos McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable I like Karl I ve known him for years but they d never said anything like that to us before says McChrystal who adds that he felt betrayed by the leak Here s one that covers his flank for the history books Now if we fail they can say I told you so The most striking example of McChrystal s usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai It is McChrystal not diplomats like Eikenberry or who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead Afghanistan The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government and since Karzai is not considered credible by his own people McChrystal has worked hard to make him so Over the past few months he has accompanied the president on more than trips around the country standing beside him at political meetings or shuras in Kandahar In the day before the doomed offensive in Marja McChrystal even drove over to the president s palace to get him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year Karzai s staff however insisted that the president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed After several hours of haggling McChrystal finally enlisted the aid of Afghanistan s defense minister who persuaded Karzai s people to wake the president from his nap This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal s counterinsurgency strategy The need to build a credible government puts us at the mercy of whatever tin pot leader we ve backed a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his cable Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less than ideal partner He s been locked up in his palace the past year laments one of the general s top advisers At times Karzai himself has actively undermined McChrystal s desire to put him in charge During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center Karzai met three U S soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province General he called out to McChrystal I didn t even know we were fighting in Uruzgan Growing up as a military brat McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him throughout his career His father fought in Korea and Vietnam retiring as a two star general and his four brothers all joined the armed services Moving around to different bases McChrystal took solace in baseball a sport in which he made no pretense of hiding his superiority In Little League he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a fastball down the middle McChrystal entered West Point in when the U S military was close to its all time low in popularity His class was the last to graduate before the academy started to admit women The Prison on the Hudson as it was known then was a potent mix of testosterone hooliganism and reactionary patriotism Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called rat fucking which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or mud covered in shaving cream It was pretty out of control says Lt Gen Barno a classmate who went on to serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from to The class filled with what Barno calls huge talent and wild eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism also produced Gen Ray Odierno the current commander of U S forces in Iraq The son of a general McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents a dual role that taught him how to thrive in a rigid top down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got He accumulated more than hours of demerits for drinking partying and insubordination a record that his classmates boasted made him a century man One classmate who asked not to be named recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink The troublemaking almost got him kicked out and he spent hours subjected to forced marches in the Area a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined I d come visit and I d end up spending most of my time in the library while Stan was in the Area recalls Annie who began dating McChrystal in McChrystal wound up ranking out of a class of a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as brilliant His most compelling work was extracurricular As managing editor of The Pointer the West Point literary magazine McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his career In one tale a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight in another a year old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist In Brinkman s Note a piece of suspense fiction the unnamed narrator appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president It turns out however that the narrator himself is the assassin and he s able to infiltrate the White House The President strode in smiling From the right coat pocket of the raincoat I carried I slowly drew forth my caliber pistol In Brinkman s failure I had succeeded After graduation nd Lt Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam We really felt we were a peacetime generation he recalls There was the Gulf War but even that didn t feel like that big of a deal So McChrystal spent his career where the action was He enrolled in Forces school and became a regimental commander of the rd Ranger Battalion in It was a dangerous position even in peacetime nearly two dozen Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties It was also an unorthodox career path Most soldiers who want to climb the ranks to general don t go the Rangers Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers outdated McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers He introduced mixed martial arts required every soldier to qualify with night vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks In the late s McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game spending a year at Harvard s Kennedy School of Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations where he co authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks of humanitarian interventionism But as he moved up through the ranks McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as a troublemaking kid at West Point knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting tossed out Being a highly intelligent badass he discovered could take you far especially in the political chaos that followed th He was very focused says Annie Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he wanted to do I don t think his personality has changed in all these years By some accounts McChrystal s career should have been over at least two times by now As Pentagon spokesman during the invasion of Iraq the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up and coming commander with a reputation for speaking his mind When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous stuff happens remark during the looting of McChrystal backed him up A few days later he echoed the president s Mission Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over But it was during his next stint overseeing the military s most elite units including the Rangers Navy Seals and Delta Force that McChrystal took part in a cover up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man After Cpl Pat Tillman the former NFL star turned Ranger was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters He signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire McChrystal would later claim he didn t read the recommendation closely enough a strange excuse for a commander known for his laserlike attention to minute details A week later McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman s death If the circumstances of Corporal Tillman s death become public he wrote it could cause public embarrassment for the president The false narrative which McChrystal clearly helped construct diminished Pat s true actions wrote Tillman s mother Mary in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk McChrystal got away with it she added because he was the golden boy of Rumsfeld and Bush who loved his willingness to get things done even if it included bending the rules or skipping the chain of command Nine days after Tillman s death McChrystal was promoted to major general Two years later in McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in Iraq According to a report by Human Rights Watch prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now familiar litany of abuse stress positions being dragged naked through the mud McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal even though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times But the experience was so unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in Afghanistan viewing them as a political swamp according to a U S official In as McChrystal prepared for his confirmation hearings his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover up But the scandals barely made a ripple in Congress and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in Afghanistan The media to a large extent have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies Where Gen Petraeus is kind of a dweeb a teacher s pet with a Ranger s tab McChrystal is a snake eating rebel a Jedi commander as Newsweek called him He didn t care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk He speaks his mind with a candor rare for a high ranking official He asks for opinions and seems genuinely interested in the response He gets briefings on his iPod and listens to books on tape He carries a custom made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name and four stars and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee There are no limits There are only plateaus and you must not stay there you must go beyond them He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq unprecedented for a top commander and turned up on missions unannounced with almost no entourage The fucking lads love Stan McChrystal says a British officer who serves in Kabul You d be out in Somewhere Iraq and someone would take a knee beside you and a corporal would be like Who the fuck is that And it s fucking Stan McChrystal It doesn t hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Operations Command the elite forces that carry out the government s darkest ops During the Iraq surge his team killed and captured thousands of insurgents including Abu Musab al Zarqawi the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq JSOC was a killing machine says Maj Gen Mayville his chief of operations McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing He systematically mapped out terrorist networks targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned by the military The Boss would find the year old kid with a nose ring with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT sitting in the corner with computer monitors humming says a Forces commando who worked with McChrystal in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul He d say Hey you fucking muscleheads couldn t find lunch without help You got to work together with these guys Even in his new role as America s leading evangelist for counterinsurgency McChrystal retains the deep seated instincts of a terrorist hunter To put pressure on the Taliban he has upped the number of Forces units in Afghanistan from four to You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the hallway at headquarters Then he ll add I m going to have to scold you in the morning for it though In fact the general frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency In the first four months of this year NATO forces killed some civilians up percent from the same period in a record that has created tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over In a Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover up and in protests erupted in Kandahar after U S forces accidentally shot up a bus killing five Afghans We ve shot an amazing number of people McChrystal recently conceded Despite the tragedies and miscues McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that the U S military has ever encountered in a war zone It s insurgent math as he calls it for every innocent person you kill you create new enemies He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving put restrictions on the use of air power and severely limited night raids He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed and berates commanders responsible for civilian deaths For a while says one U S official the most dangerous place to be in Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a civ cas incident The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make not killing something you can win an award for There s talk of creating a new medal for courageous restraint a buzzword that s unlikely to gain much traction in the gung ho culture of the U S military But however strategic they may be McChrystal s new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own troops Being told to hold their fire soldiers complain puts them in greater danger Bottom line says a former Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts His rules of engagement put soldiers lives in even greater danger Every real soldier will tell you the same thing In McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar to confront such accusations from the troops directly It was a typically bold move by the general Only two days earlier he had received an e mail from Israel Arroyo a year old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit I am writing because it was said you don t care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves Arroyo wrote Within hours McChrystal responded personally I m saddened by the accusation that I don t care about soldiers as it is something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally at least I do But I know perceptions depend upon your perspective at the time and I respect that every soldier s view is his own Then he showed up at Arroyo s outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops not some bullshit photo op stroll through a market but a real live operation in a dangerous war zone Six weeks later just before McChrystal returned from Paris the general received another e mail from Arroyo A year old corporal named Ingram one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with had been killed by an IED a day earlier It was the third man the member platoon had lost in a year and Arroyo was writing to see if the general would attend Ingram s memorial service He started to look up to you Arroyo wrote McChrystal said he would try to make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt Arroyo s platoon for the memorial I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with JFM is a small encampment ringed by high blast walls and guard towers Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan and have seen some of the worst fighting of both wars But they are especially angered by Ingram s death His commanders had repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed noting that it was often used as a combat position by the Taliban But due to McChrystal s new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians the request had been denied These were abandoned houses fumes Staff Sgt Kennith Hicks Nobody was coming back to live in them One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force the laminated card reads For a soldier who has traveled halfway around the world to fight that s like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won t have to make arrests Does that make any fucking sense asks Pfc Jared Pautsch We should just drop a fucking bomb on this place You sit and ask yourself What are we doing here The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended they ve been distorted as they passed through the chain of command but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground Fuck when I came over here and heard that McChrystal was in charge I thought we would get our fucking gun on says Hicks who has served three tours of combat I get COIN I get all that McChrystal comes here explains it it makes sense But then he goes away on his bird and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army they re all fucked up either because somebody is trying to cover their ass or because they just don t understand it themselves But we re fucking losing this thing McChrystal and his team show up the next day Underneath a tent the general has a minute discussion with some two dozen soldiers The atmosphere is tense I ask you what s going on in your world and I think it s important for you all to understand the big picture as well McChrystal begins How s the company doing You guys feeling sorry for yourselves Anybody Anybody feel like you re losing McChrystal says Sir some of the guys here sir think we re losing sir says Hicks McChrystal nods Strength is leading when you just don t want to lead he tells the men You re leading by example That s what we do Particularly when it s really really hard and it hurts inside Then he spends minutes talking about counterinsurgency diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard He makes COIN seem like common sense but he s careful not to bullshit the men We are knee deep in the decisive year he tells them The Taliban he insists no longer has the initiative but I don t think we do either It s similar to the talk he gave in Paris but it s not winning any hearts and minds among the soldiers This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks McChrystal tries to joke But it doesn t get the same reception from infantry companies During the question and answer period the frustration boils over The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use lethal force about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence They want to be able to fight like they did in Iraq like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal We aren t putting fear the Taliban one soldier says Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing McChrystal says citing an oft repeated maxim that you can t kill your way out of Afghanistan The Russians killed million Afghans and that didn t work I m not saying go out and kill everybody sir the soldier persists You say we ve stopped the momentum of the insurgency I don t believe that s true in this area The more we pull back the more we restrain ourselves the stronger it s getting I agree with you McChrystal says In this area we ve not made progress probably You have to show strength here you have to use fire What I m telling you is fire costs you What do you want to do You want to wipe the population out here and resettle it A soldier complains that under the rules any insurgent who doesn t have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a civilian That s the way this game is McChrystal says It s complex I can t just decide It s shirts and skins and we ll kill all the shirts As the discussion ends McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn t succeeded at easing the men s anger He makes one last ditch effort to reach them acknowledging the death of Cpl Ingram There s no way I can make that easier he tells them No way I can pretend it won t hurt No way I can tell you not to feel that I will tell you you re doing a great job Don t let the frustration get to you The session ends with no clapping and no real resolution McChrystal may have sold President Obama on counterinsurgency but many of his own men aren t buying it When it comes to Afghanistan history is not on McChrystal s side The only foreign invader to have any success here was Genghis Khan and he wasn t hampered by things like human rights economic development and press scrutiny The COIN doctrine bizarrely draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent memory France s nasty war in Algeria lost in and the American misadventure in Vietnam lost in McChrystal like other advocates of COIN readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy expensive and easy to lose Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan he says But even if he somehow manages to succeed after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U S homeland the war will do little to shut down Al Qaeda which has shifted its operations to Pakistan Dispatching troops to build new schools roads mosques and water treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock It s all very cynical politically says Marc Sageman a former CIA case officer who has extensive experience in the region Afghanistan is not in our vital interest there s nothing for us there In mid two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar McChrystal travels to the White House for a high level visit by Hamid Karzai It is a triumphant moment for the general one that demonstrates he is very much in command both in Kabul and in Washington In the East Room which is packed with journalists and dignitaries President Obama sings the praises of Karzai The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is about the pain they feel over civilian casualties They mention the word progress times in under an hour But there is no mention of victory Still the session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal s strategy in months There is no denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years in education in health care and economic development the president says As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed lights that would not have been visible just a few years earlier It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make During the worst years in Iraq when the Bush administration had no real progress to point to officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success It was one of our first impressions one GOP official said in after landing in at the height of the sectarian violence So many lights shining brightly So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned talk of progress of city lights of metrics like health care and education Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have mocked They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory because victory is not even defined or recognizable says Celeste Ward a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political adviser to U S commanders in Iraq in That s the game we re in right now What we need for strategic purposes is to create the perception that we didn t get run off The facts on the ground are not great and are not going to become great in the near future But facts on the ground as history has proven offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course Even those closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti war sentiment at home doesn t begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things are in Afghanistan If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war it would become even less popular a senior adviser to McChrystal says Such realism however doesn t prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from dreaming big Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year as Obama promised the military hopes to ramp up its counterinsurgency campaign even further There s a possibility we could ask for another surge of U S forces next summer if we see success here a senior military official in Kabul tells me Back in Afghanistan less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of progress McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency Since last year the Pentagon had been planning to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar the country s second largest city and the Taliban s original home base It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war the primary reason for the troop surge that McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year But on th acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more groundwork the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall Rather than one big battle like Fallujah or Ramadi U S troops will implement what McChrystal calls a rising tide of security The Afghan police and army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods while the U S pours million of aid the city to win over the civilian population Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard pressed to explain the new plan This isn t a classic operation says a U S military official It s not going to be Black Hawk Down There aren t going to be doors kicked in Other U S officials insist that doors are going to be kicked in but that it s going to be a kinder gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja The Taliban have a jackboot on the city says a military official We have to remove them but we have to do it in a way that doesn t alienate the population When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office insiders say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall This looks like CT plus he said according to U S officials familiar with the meeting Whatever the nature of the new plan the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency After nine years of war the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U S military to openly attack The very people that COIN seeks to win over the Afghan people do not want us there Our supposed ally President Karzai used his influence to delay the offensive and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things worse Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem says Wilder an expert at Tufts University who has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan A tsunami of cash fuels corruption delegitimizes the government and creates an environment where we re picking winners and losers a process that fuels resentment and hostility among the civilian population So far counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never ending demand for the primary product supplied by the military perpetual war There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using the word victory when he talks about Afghanistan Winning it would seem is not really possible Not even with Stanley McChrystal in charge This article originally appeared in RS from

3671,An interview with Yeo,See hus analysis of where we are on EAS but also on the US Japan and Chinese urbanization and trade patterns Nothing that new but valuable coming from him The Australian Jun Embracing everyone from the US to India Greg Sheridan Foreign editor GEORGE Yeo Singapore s Foreign Minister is one of the most dazzlingly clever people you could meet in Southeast Asia Singapore is a society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook But Yeo combines Singapore s characteristic hard headedness with a depth of historical understanding and context as well as a lively human sympathy for the diversity of the region that surrounds him which I at any event find almost unique I remember interviewing him at the height of the East Asian economic crisis in and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of Asia as the growing centre of the global economy as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were then suggesting No it doesn t Yeo told me At the most it might put back the forecasts by five or years It moved the graph a little to the right it didn t change the trends On that Yeo was absolutely right But it is also Yeo s ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable This week Yeo spent a few days in Australia and I caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historical tour de force conversations in which he specialises It is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudd s proposal to establish an Asia Pacific Community The Prime Minister wanted the US India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal with strategic issues as well as trade and economics Singapore s hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thought that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of which it is a key member could be sidelined I asked Yeo whether the region was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to accomplish We still need a lot more discussion he said The vision is going to change dramatically with the emergence of China and India on the global stage The configuration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred But that s the reality we ve got to work with We need a regional architecture which is able to accommodate the stresses The single most important relationship is between the US and China Increasingly the relationship between India and China is becoming more important I think eventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century the triangle consisting of the US China and India Yeo saw Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen in Canberra and now describes Canberra and Singapore as being in harmony on the evolution of regional organisations This is how he saw it having played out When Prime Minister Rudd proposed the APC Dick Woolcott Rudd s envoy went round the region He did not visit all countries He made it quite plain to some that only the big countries of ASEAN need to be involved We talked among ourselves and quite soon the conclusion was reached that ASEAN was going to be sidelined So there was an immediate blowback from the region To PM Rudd s credit he quickly clarified this that ASEAN is central to his conception of the APC and that that was his vision from the very beginning I said All of us in the region are very relieved to hear that Separately we had former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama articulating his view of an East Asian region apparently centred on China Japan and Korea It created as you would expect a natural reaction in Southeast Asia That got us all thinking in the region How to keep Russia and the US in the region in a way that s comfortable For a long time we ve been thinking about China more recently about India Yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations also evolved slowly in particular the East Asia Summit which includes Australia and New Zealand as well as ASEAN China Japan South Korea and India He said It took us a long time to create the EAS structure Some preferred it to be based on the ASEAN plus three China Japan Korea harking back to former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad s East Asian caucus Others felt that s too limiting If it s just ASEAN plus three that may be a little lop sided because of the economic weight of the plus three So we thought if we have India on one side and Australia and New Zealand to the south there s a certain natural equipoise Then it took many discussions The Russians wanted to join the EAS but we felt this should not be rushed Russia is too important a country There was some unhappiness from the Russians that we did not accommodate them in the EAS at that time Former US President W Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS might exclude the US from the region We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing because Australia and New Zealand were in it In any case countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive What would threaten us most is if the world developed blocs So where do we end up today When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN So now there are two possibilities either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight including the US and Russia configuration In fact I had a very interesting discussion with Prime Minister Rudd I think in the end he s happy to let ASEAN members decide and he doesn t want to interfere in our regional discussion So you can describe what Yeo outlines as either a win or a loss for Rudd Whatever evolves nobody is going to call it the Asia Pacific Community and no one is going to imagine that Rudd was its founder as everyone accepts that Bob Hawke founded APEC in On the other hand it does seem as though it s very much more than likely that there will finally be a regional organisation embracing everyone from the US to India which is able to discuss security That is pretty much Rudd s policy aim and as Yeo constructively puts it Rudd has influenced ASEAN thinking Friends of Rudd can describe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative His enemies can say the APC came to nothing and was a failure in Australian diplomacy Certainly Yeo casts it in a constructive light There is only space to give the smallest sampling of Yeo s prodigiously rich insights on other issues On the US he said Both Australia and Singapore feel it in our bones that the US will remain a great power for many decades It is a vast country always throwing up new ideas always on the boil It has a sunny disposition We in Singapore and Australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties On China I asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power financial and military so it could manage that new power in a way that was beneficial to everybody Yeo stressed that he was sure Beijing s preoccupations were internal and said China is the No trading partner for Japan Korea Taiwan Hong Kong India and already No for New Zealand and for all the countries in Asia the graph points in the same direction The historical process is high drama in China It was historically because of the large rural peasantry that Maoism developed as a different ideology from Bolshevism China was per cent urban It s now per cent urban and will go to per cent or per cent The urbanisation of Europe was languid by comparison but look at Dickens or Victor Hugo Look at the huge reaction in Europe to urbanisation and industrialisation In China it s all compressed If they succeed they will be the greatest nation on Earth The Chinese know they have to learn new tricks The skills which brought them to power won t keep them in power He recalled that early in China s economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how Singapore as a mostly Chinese nation ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner combining rapid economic growth with social order and a respect for tradition Then that interest seemed to wane But now Chinese delegations are back again in large numbers fascinated particularly with how Singapore manages the politics of being a big and booming city Mainland Chinese are even sitting in on politicians electoral clinics in Singapore observing how real problems are recognised integrated the system and dealt with I asked Yeo too whether he thought Japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in Asia these past years He replied Their politics now are a mess Partly because they fit the pieces together so closely reconfiguring the pieces is difficult A lot of Japanese politics now is not about fitting the pieces together but pulling them apart The DP came to power determined to pull the pieces apart the Liberal Democratic Party from big business from the bureacracy Never write Japan off It takes a long time for them to change but when they do change they do it with a fury and intensity that surprises everyone Japan has gone through profound periods of change in the past the Meiji Restoration of the th century in which it decided to become a modern nation or the pervasive change after World War II in which it decided to embrace democracy and the role of the key US ally in the region The fact that it is now grappling with change is no reason to think it cannot emerge again with a successful model Yeo is an old old friend of Australia and in a sense a long term champion of Australia s involvement in Southeast Asia He has been a minister in the Singapore government for more than years He embodies a great deal of institutional memory and strategic continuity not just within Singapore but within the broader councils of the region It s just a pity he doesn t visit us a bit more often

3709,NYT,Top Civilians Face Rockiness in Afghan Shift By MARK LANDLER The New York Times Thu WASHINGTON As General H Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan the two top American civilian officials in the war face an uncertain and tricky future working with a newly empowered military leader under the gaze of an impatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together C the Obama administration s special representative to the region and Karl W Eikenberry the ambassador to Afghanistan both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen Stanley A McChrystal s career ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine But privately at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal s exit as an excuse for a housecleaning according to senior officials That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support these people said In recent days other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might be replaced by Ryan C Crocker the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeus during the successful Iraq troop increase Such a prospect is viewed as remote given Mr Crocker s prestigious new post at Texas A M University But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry as he adapts to a new partner one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should work together in war It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine year old war setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement Prior to General Petraeus s arrival some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several forceful ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities Administration officials acknowledge that as one said There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team But the White House believes that the current lineup can mesh and that a difficult war demands this much talent Still the McChrystal blow up has reverberated through the State Department Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr to take a hard look at the civilian team two officials said She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles they said You can t have a major shift in a civ mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything said a senior State Department official using the jargon for a civilian military campaign Be General Petraeus whose appointment was approved by the Senate on took pains at his confirmation hearing on to back a unified civilian and military effort He noted then that he had telephoned Mr and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels so the two could land in Kabul together has been my wingman to a great degree General Petraeus said in an interview We have had and do have a very good relationship That role he said will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon s proposal last year to send additional troops to Afghanistan which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal But in fact General Petraeus was the true architect of the plan The ambassador a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan graduated from West Point in a year ahead of General Petraeus but they did not know each other at the academy The two share a scholarly bent General Petraeus holds a Ph D from Princeton while Ambassador Eikenberry has Master s degrees from Harvard and Stanford While they were never assigned together their careers intersected twice In Iraq General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the st Airborne Division in Mosul When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr turned down requests for an interview Mr Crocker now the dean of the Bush School of Government at Texas A M did not return a call for comment For Mr the new landscape is challenging in other ways Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago when his ouster was the subject of endless Washington chatter Yet he has arguably become a less central player J Lew a deputy secretary of state manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr helped shape while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out Mr s current portfolio has played to his weaknesses his own allies admit He is best as a high level negotiator and not as comfortable with the nitty gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an economy These days Mr has become a globe trotting diplomat trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt helping Afghanistan At a recent conference of countries in Madrid Mr drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government s campaign to reintegrate Taliban fighters mainstream society Mr Karzai s longer term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders and his negotiations with Pakistan could propel Mr back a central role Were these talks to become more serious several officials said Mr s negotiating skills could be put to use as a broker and guardian of American interests For now though as evidence of General Petraeus s influence he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad On his last visit to the region Mr met with Mr Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials including the army chief of staff Ashfaq Parvez Kayani Mr s past run ins with Mr Karzai several officials said have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader and Pakistani officials said they trusted him Husain Haqqani Pakistan s ambassador to Washington said that Mr took time to understand Pakistan s concerns Ambassador is liked by some admired by others and seen as effective even by those who may not like him Mr Haqqani said Still General Petraeus is indisputably the key player and he has wasted no time asserting his control On a secure videoconference call last a person familiar with the call said General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly and controversial plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target Mr and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented

3723,what Max did on July 31.,http maxblumenthal com the summer camp of destruction israeli high schoolers join in the destructionrof a bedouin town The Summer Camp Of Destruction Israeli High Schoolers Assist The Razing Of A Bedouin Town On By Max AL ARAKIB ISRAEL On Israeli police demolished buildings in the unrecognized Bedouin village of al Arakib razing the entire village to the ground to make way for a Jewish National Fund forest The destruction was part of a larger project to force the Bedouin community of the Negev away from their ancestral lands and seven Indian reservation style communities the Israeli government has constructed for them The land will then be open for Jewish settlers including young couples in the army and those who may someday be evacuated from the West Bank after a peace treaty is signed For now the Israeli government intends to uproot as many villages as possible and erase them from the map by establishing facts on the ground in the form of JNF forests See video of of al Arakib s demolition here Moments before the destruction of the Bedouin village of al Arakib Israeli high school age police volunteers lounge on furniture taken from a family s home The following four photos are by Ata Abu Madyam of Arab Negev News One of the most troubling aspects of the destruction of al Arakib was a report by CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riot police who stormed the village were accompanied by busloads of cheering civilians Who were these civilians and why didn t CNN or any outlet investigate further I traveled to al Arakib yesterday with a delegation from Ta ayush an Israeli group that promotes a joint Arab Jewish struggle against the occupation The activists spent the day preparing games and activities for the village s traumatized children helping the villagers replace their uprooted olive groves and assisting in the reconstruction of their demolished homes In a massive makeshift tent where many of al Arakib s residents now sleep I interviewed village leaders about the identity of the cheering civilians Each one confirmed the presence of the civilians describing how they celebrated the demolitions As I compiled details the story grew increasingly horrific After interviewing more than a half dozen elders of the village I was able to finally identify the civilians in question What I discovered was more disturbing than I had ima med Israeli police youth volunteers pick through the belongings an al Arakib family Arab Negev News publisher Ata Abu Madyam supplied me with a series of photos he took of the civilians in action They depicted Israeli high school students who appeared to have volunteered as members of the Israeli police civilian guard I am working on identifying some participants by name Prior to the demolitions the student volunteers were sent the villagers homes to extract their furniture and belongings A number of villagers including Madyam told me the volunteers smashed windows and mirrors in their homes and defaced family photographs with crude drawings Then they lounged around on the furniture of al Arakib residents in plain site of the owners Finally according to Matyam the volunteers celebrated while bulldozers destroyed the homes What we learned from the summer camp of destruction Madyam remarked is that Israeli youth are not being educated on democracy they are being raised on racism The cover of the latest issue of Madyam s Arab Negev News features a photo of Palestinians being expelled to Jordan in juxtaposed with a photo of a family fleeing al Arakib last week The headline reads Nakba According to residents of al Arakib the youth volunteers vandalized homes throughout the village The Israeli civilian guard which incorporates citizens including youth as young as about of Israeli police volunteers are teenagers is one of many programs designed to incorporate Israeli children the state s military apparatus It is not hard to imagine what lessons the high school students who participated in the leveling of al Arakib took from their experience nor is it especially difficult to predict what sort of citizens they will become once they reach adulthood Not only are they being indoctrinated to swear blind allegiance to the military they are learning to treat the Arab outclass as less than human The volunteers behavior toward Bedouins who are citizens of Israel and serve loyally in Israeli army combat units despite widespread racism was strikingly reminiscent of the behavior of settler youth in Hebron who pelt Palestinian shopkeepers in the old city with eggs rocks and human waste If there is a distinction between the two cases it is that the Hebron settlers act as vigilantes while the teenagers of Israeli civilian guard vandalize Arab property as agents of the state The spectacle of Israeli youth helping destroy al Arakib helps explain why of Jewish Israeli high school students do not believe Arabs should be allowed to serve in the Knesset why the next generation wants apartheid Indeed the widespread indoctrination of Israeli youth by the military apparatus is a central factor in Israel s authoritarian trend It would be difficult for any adolescent boy to escape from an experience like al Arakib where adults in heroic warror garb encoura e him to articipate in and gloat over acts of massive destruction with even a trace of democratic values Youth volunteers extract belongings from village homes as bulldozers move in As for the present condition of Israeli democracy it is essential to consider the way in which the state pits its own citizens against one another enlisting the Jewish majority as conquerers while targeting the Arab others as in the wordsI of Zionist founding father Chaim Weizmann obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path Historically only failing states have encouraged such corrosive dynamics to take hold That is why the scenes from al Arakib from the demolished homes to the uprooted gardens to the grinning teens who joined the mayhem can be viewed as much more than the destruction of a village They are snapshots of the phenomenon that is laying Israeli society as a whole to waste and the destruction begins

3745,FW: Update on Reporting,FYI a video and note that will make you smile Enjoy jm Closing Wrap up Video from Forum produced by IIP and huge hit http www youtube com watch v uZ kpXbql c Thank you Letter from Cameroon Delegate to Embassy Dear All Good morning from Washington DC I trust that we are keeping well I just want to use this opportunity to say that today we come to the end of the program here on the President s Forum All along this Forum and especially during the White House meeting with President Obama I have been asking myself what it means to be here in DC and to be representing Cameroon at this forum I have recently come to the realization that the time is critical and that President Obama in his thinking about a new Africa believes that young people whom we are diverse and intelligently different can take little positive actions to ensure that the next years witnesses significant changes in our social processes our political institutions processes and structures our economic freedom taking consideration our cultural specificities While traveling to America I kept imagining the moment when President Obama would tell us great and magical ways to getting out of our current socio economic and especially political hostage situations but in all and after all the speeches conversations and interactions with Ordinary Americans like in the Southside of Washington DC State Department Staff Senators Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama I noticed that America can only partner with us when we decide to start thinking and acting differently in our quest for a better Cameroon and a better Africa This thinking differently is exemplified by the American Peace Corps in the service leadership the spirit of give back to the nation and community and the transformation of challenges to opportunities in America and in many nations around the world When our troubles and challenges seems gruesome and our vision blurred by the thought and fear of the unknown if we dared the one thing I come out with from this Forum is this That we just have to Think Speak out and above all DARE take some innovative ACTIONs to Be the change we want to see in our communities nations and continent and commit others to same by our examples That we have to build strong networks and undertake advocacies as a group as nothing has ever stopped a committed group of people to drive change aound the world The work to be done is enormous and challenging but sure the reward of every success like coming to America to the White House and meeting with President Obama is sweet Therefore I come back to work to be the change I want to see in Cameroon I thank you all for the opportunity

3799,"H: Very good analysis of Iran from Gary Sick, I think. Sid",Gary Sick America and Iran Strikes Sanctions and Scapegoats For the pundits there are only two questions about U S Iran relations that are of any importance Will Israel and or the United States attack Iran and will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to change its nuclear policy Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues the answers are an easy no and no Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table thereby giving the pundits and the crowd that is dying to repeat Iraq latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages where it has been for years As a lede it sells columns and newspapers so it will not go away But as analysis it is either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment Uber neocon Bolton had it right If any such attack were to occur it would have been at the end of the Bush administration when there was nothing left to lose Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted it unequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in Dick Cheney apparently agreed judging from his subsequent statements of regret So it is fair to say that W Bush after looking the potential consequences resisted the advice of his neocon advisers his previously dominant vice president and the reported direct request from the government of Israel and rejected a strike What is the likelihood that Barack Obama with the same catastrophic scenario before him will approve Forget it Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their security and survival or even their self image Just look at Saddam Hussein The international sanctions imposed on Iraq in the s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison Every item that went in and out of Iraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States Yet although Iraq had abandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people and his enemies know that Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that there was no immediate necessity to come clean They after all controlled the smuggling routes And their henchmen managed the thriving and enormously lucrative black market As for concern with their own people a rotund Tariq Aziz sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar informed a worried UN representative that it would be good for the Iraqi people to lose some weight An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions had made criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive The biggest and most successful of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddam Hussein Which brings us to Iran The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated They have built a web of financial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significant problems for the leadership Iran s critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable It is in a pincer Because of cheap energy prices inside the country artificially propped up by massive subsidies energy demand is soaring This siphons off a lot of Iran s oil production which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hard currency At the same time because Iran s oil fields are old and complex they require modern technology to maintain production That technology and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oil companies has been absent for many years It was driven away partly by the sanctions ironically assisted by Iran s own short sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outside investors As a result Iran s oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soaked up by domestic consumption In a period of relatively low oil prices this means that Iran s hard currency earnings are drying up at an alarming rate This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competent economic management team of any major country in the world Ayatollah Khamene i the Supreme Leader seems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the Revolutionary Guards who surround and protect him The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah s regime could have imagined President Ahmadinejad also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards is free to indulge his taste for outlandish and irresponsible rhetoric His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him but the effect drives away prospective investors and facilitates the U S drive to enlist international support for sanctions against Iran An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossad agent no one he observed had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes At the same time under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits But to be fair Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the third rail of Iranian politics the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy His initial efforts to reduce the amount of subsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation including torching filling stations But these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran s energy dilemma He is now addressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants This has also resulted in outrage including closing the bazaars in Iran and other major cities But his campaign seems to be making progress These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer including the International Monetary Fund Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economic interests by his belligerent rhetoric always casting himself as the champion of the little guy In that he resembles his populist predecessors from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez Ahmadinejad takes on America and Israel the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil But like other populists Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of his own eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions It is whether Iran is capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world The Revolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran s military its economy and its politics Iran increasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the s and s that we call fascist Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons from the millenarians on the far right who choose to believe that Khamene i is the personal representative of God on earth to the pragmatic conservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership to the reformists of the Green movement whose objective is to put the republic back the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix No one knows what is going to happen next And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with The danger is not that the administration will back the wrong horse in Iran The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied with domestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it will inadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoat for everything that goes wrong in Iran

3803,Davutoglu call,Here is what PJ said on the subject The Secretary this morning spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu regarding Iran During the call the Secretary stressed that in our view Iran s recent diplomacy was an attempt to stop Security Council action without actually taking steps to address international concerns about its nuclear program There s nothing new and nothing encouraging in Iran s recent statements It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the international community which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal It has yet to formally respond to the IAEA She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensify efforts to apply greater pressure on Iran That was the primary purpose of the conversation They briefly touched on other subjects including Middle East peace and the relationship between Turkey and Azerbaijan

3805,Iran human rights statement,One thing I forgot to mention Bill B and Mike Posner recommend that you release the below statement Apparently Hamidi s execution is imminent With your approval we ll put out DRAFT STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON Urging Iran to Respect the Fundamental Freedoms of its Citizens The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights as well as to intimidate and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and who stand up for the rights of their fellow citizens We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani who garnered international attention for her verdict of death by stoning While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning her fate has been left unclear We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi an year old charged with homosexuality faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation Neither of their cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Iran s own constitution and their lawyer Mohammad Mostafaei felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authorities and his family members had been detained We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right to free expression after the elections including Jafar Kazemi Mohammad Haj Aghaei and Javad Lan The United States urges the Iranian government to halt these executions in accordance with its international obligations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners and imprisoned human rights defenders The United States will continue to stand with people all around the world who seek to exercise their universal rights and to speak out in defense of human liberties

3830,Corker,And pasted below is the exchange between Corker and CORKER Mr Chairman thank you I want to thank the ambassador for coming I know he has a wealth of knowledge and certainly served our country for many years A number of us wrote a letter to you asking for this hearing and my guess is you might have had hearings any way But the reason we wrote the letter bipartisan letter was to provide Congress and the American people with a definition of the end state for our civilian operations in Afghanistan clear objectives for the civilian mission and a detailed plan for achieving those objectives and the very specific measurable metrics being used to measure progress towards achieving those objectives I have to say I ve been here for an hour and minutes I have heard nothing nothing about that And while I respect the ambassador I ve heard a lot of process I ve heard a lot about meetings I have no earthly idea no earthly idea what our objectives are on the civilian front And I don t know if you have time to begin doing that right now but this has so far been an incredible waste of time from the standpoint of of hearing though And I have tremendous respect for you but maybe we have the wrong witness I hope we ll have maybe Secretary Clinton and Eikenberry maybe Crocker I know he s supposed to come But could you answer the question that was the purpose of these hearings in the first place HOLBROOKE I m sorry You don t feel that I ve told you what our civilian programs are CORKER You ve told me a lot of process I d like to know a definition of what our end state is for civilian operations the very question we asked when we set this hearing up is in Afghanistan clear objectives for the for the detailed plan for achieving those I d like to hear you talk about that I mean I m glad we have a lot of interagency folks here but I m not hearing anything that talks about where we re going I d also like to know how the withdrawal date that s been set affects that and how it affects those we re working with in the country HOLBROOKE First of all Senator Corker I believe I have discussed our civilian programs in very considerable detail within the constraints of time but we did prepare a report for this committee earlier this year which was entered the record and which I will be happy to enter the record again if you wish And you can go through every one of the programs The reason I brought my colleagues with me was to show that this was a whole of government an unprecedented effort Now on the specifics since you want specifics Afghanistan is an agricultural country It exported agricultural products until and the Soviet invasion We are trying to rebuild it This was not being done for the first seven years of this war We have your your committee has given us a great deal of money for agriculture And we are spending it wisely in a joint AID USDA effort which Senator Lugar has particularly been involved in food seeds cash for work programs encouraging alternatives to opium production HOLBROOKE Secondly rule of law We are spending we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create a justice system which can cut the Taliban s propaganda about corruption and lack of a justice system Third counter narcotics We have ended poppy eradication a radical change because all we were doing by eradicating poppy seeds poppy crops was driving farmers poor farmers the hands of the Taliban Fourth a major program of subnational governance where we are putting aid directly to the district level Fifth a major effort in specific areas some of which were alluded to earlier such as electricity for Kandahar Senator Kerry asked earlier about Kandahar One of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as a benefit of the international presence The whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support General Petraeus counter insurgency effort He and I I was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to Kabul We have worked intimately in an effort to create a joint civilian military effort And I am happy to provide you with every detail you wish in private briefings on of me and my team Point number two in regard to the end state issue you raised I want to be clear on the difference between end state and exit strategy If we this is my personal view senator but if we walk away from Afghanistan again as we did years ago the consequences will be similarly catastrophic because of the unique strategic position of Afghanistan and the reaction that would have in Pakistan China India and the country to Afghanistan s west Iran as well as the larger region that includes Russia Saudi Arabia India and even extending to Western Europe which is concerned about terrorism from that region just as much as we are So I hope that when we talk about end state we talk about a sustainable end state which involves continued American economic and development assistance and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and the military This will not be cheap But it will be a fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated for the military campaign When we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say But it won t be on a single day It will be a gradual process And that is what the review in and the president s decision making will focus on CORKER In our foreign policy generally speaking I know we ve had some rough times over the last several years it s been something that we ve been able to address in a bipartisan way And I think that the issues that you re dealing with that we re dealing with in Afghanistan are incredibly tough I still don t I haven t understood what the administration was saying in the beginning That s not to be critical of them I just don t understand I still don t understand I ve met with you and your staff over at the State Department It s just incredibly vague to me And I think what we are doing we have partners which include the Pakistanis and everybody around that they don t know what we re doing They don t know when we re leaving They think we re leaving shortly I think We ve just had colleagues who have come from there We ve had a we ve got a president there that s having to play both sides because he wants to survive because he doesn t know what our intentions are The Pakistanis don t know what our intentions are I don t think And they re making accommodations on both sides So I just have to tell you I send letters to parents and spouses And what I feel because of this lack of clarity is that we are in Afghanistan because we re in Afghanistan and that we don t have the will to be successful And we don t have the will to leave because of some of the things you just outlined But I just don t hear any clarity And again I want to support the administration I want to support you because that s what we need to do as a country is let the shores ph align ph let the partisanship But I have to tell you as a person who wants to do that I still don t understand OK And I have average intelligence so I would ask you to please or maybe let s have some witnesses in here that can shed more light or be more specific But I don t understand and I m very concerned And I think we re sending a lot of mixed signals And I think there s a lot of dissension Actually as I listen to you even within the administration itself and that has to end And I just ask you please You have a lot of experience help us understand You haven t done that today And I would ask the chairman to please have some witnesses come in and explain to us what the end state is what we can envision Afghanistan being whenever this withdrawal does take place because I still do not understand We ve changed it Now it s sort of a degraded country where they have conflict but it s not out of control I mean the bar continues to change And I m just concerned as an individual and yet I want us to be if we can all on the same page as much as possible But I think to do that this has got to be much clearer than has been outlined HOLBROOKE Senator I m sorry that my answers don t fully satisfy you But I want to be very clear on this because I understand your comments and I respect them First of all the core question the one you are asked by your constituents and I m asked by everybody why are we in Afghanistan The short simple answer is direct threats to our national security interests and the fact that while our enemies against our homeland are on the Pakistani side of the border this is a single struggle And we have to strengthen the Afghan government and let and teach it to stand on its own feet over time so that we can move forward while we do other things that fall outside the scope of this hearing to dismantle deter and defeat Al Qaida Now if you do not believe that it s a threat to the homeland then we have an honest difference of opinion But I think the Times Square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is Secondly on the civilian mission again it s in support of a single civilian military counter insurgency mission And we have benchmarks requested and required by the Congress and submitted to you And our overarching goal here is always the same to disrupt dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the United States And we believe all of us and there is no division on this in the executive branch that the situation we face out there is a direct threat We believe that before the Times Square situation occurred and I don t think anything could have proved it more vividly And to achieve this we have to degrade the Taliban as well because they are part of the enemy s structure a different part but an integral part that we face Now the Afghan government doesn t yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own How could they after years of war And so the civilian part of it the things I ve just mentioned to you police government capacity rule of law subnational government training provincial officials women s empowerment and a whole series of other major issues are part of our civilian programs And we re happy to come back up to your office we appreciated your visit to us and continue this dialogue Our civilian strategy is designed from keeping Al Qaida at bay and it s designed to help Afghan institutions establish conditions for stable governance Our plan has these benchmarks which have been briefed to you and your colleagues and we re happy to discuss them in detail at any time

3847,Readout from Afghan women's conference over the weekend.,The writer is someone who has worked with Afghan women in developing small businesses in Afghanistan and is doing a book about the experience She went back to Afghanistan for the conference that women had over the weekend and wrote the article that follows for today s Daily Beast Soraya mentioned here is one of our Women of Courage Gayle the writer told me in a separate email that De Mistura was very sympathetic and said they should be consulted that the current documents are working documents and he pledged that the women would be more inovled in the follow up He also told them that he was very impressed that they had organized themselves in this day conference to be able to play a more effective role Zakhilwal was gracious but said they were adequately consulted So it goes Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest profile attendees at s Kabul Conference but Afghan women fear their opinions won t be heard and they worry new deals with fighters will roll back their hard fought rights As Hillary Clinton prepares to attend s Kabul Conference Afghan women are delivering a plain message to government and international officials Women s voices should be heard We have to be honest With respect to the Kabul Conference we have not been consulted said Soraya Pakzad founder of a women s shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat Her comment came during an unusually heated question and answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan de Mistura marking the end of a two day women s conference We want to be involved in policy making We don t want our presence to be purely symbolic Women s rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or accords The Kabul Conference is in part built on symbolism A follow up to s London Conference the gathering marks the first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors a decision that is intended to showcase the transition from foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities More than international delegations are expected to descend upon the Afghan capital which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock Workers could be seen painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners arrival Discussions will center around five topics including economic development agriculture governance and security The goal of the half day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting and execution of the country s political and economic direction Although it remains to be seen how quickly the Afghan govemment long under resourced and beset by allegations of corruption will be able to take the reins from its international donors there is no question that Afghan ownership is the direction in which things are moving on the political economic and security fronts And that is precisely why women feel the stakes for this week s meeting are so high particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that might threaten women s rights After the Kabul Conference no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations and negotiations said Orzala Ashraf an Afghan human rights activist This is very important for us to get a serious and honest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not be silenced Ashraf and a number of other women s advocates view s talks are their last best shot at speaking out about their concerns with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at the table In another show of support Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet morning with a group of women leaders Regardless of this high profile backing many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything aside from more paper and more unkept promises Women are very tired of all these conferences the government is going to have to show commitments said Selay Ghaffar an Afghan Women s Network board member We want things to change And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul men or women are paying attention to yet another gathering to discuss their future Women in the provinces don t even know about this said Zainab a young math teacher from Helmand province I would say percent of women have no idea this is going on Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn t enough to make a difference And they say they fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban particularly in southern Afghanistan This is very dangerous said Shahida Hussain a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a community organizer during the Taliban years We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed We fear war again Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters but only if they respect women s constitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan said the women in a statement at the end of their meeting Women s rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or accords In the meantime women continue to fight for a voice as approaches After a weeklong flurry of conference calls embassy meetings and lunchtime gatherings two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak And in a small victory for women international officials agreed with Pakzad s assessment before pledging that women would be more involved going forward I agree you were not consulted said da Mistura appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister who only a few moments earlier had said that women s views had and would be included As usual

3866,AP/Afghanistan Sanctions,WASHINGTON AP The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan s Taliban with new financial sanctions in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile with insurgents The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants assets ban travel and trigger an arms embargo It follows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week and comes after calls from Gen Petraeus the top military commander in Afghanistan and Sen Carl Levin D Mich chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee for sanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan Taken together the U S and U N sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U N member countries putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions including a key member of the Haqqani network which directs operations against U S and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan Among those sanctioned was Nasiruddin Haqqani an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leads the group with his father Jalaluddin Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai the head of the Taliban s financial commission and Amir Abdullah the former treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader The sanctions placed on the three leaders as terrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations said Adam J Szubin director of Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financial networks of terrorist groups in support of the president s goal of a stable Afghanistan he said According to officials lshakzai is the head of the Taliban s financial commission has collected money for suicide attacks in Kandahar Afghanistan and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters He has served as a main financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar Abdullah has reportedly traveled to Kuwait Saudi Arabia Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings and communications with key leaders Nasiruddin Haqqani has collected funds for the Haqqani group including from al Qaida Last week Gen Petraeus the top military commander in Afghanistan urged officials to add commanders from the Haqqani network to the terrorist list At the time administration officials said a review was under way largely accelerated after the failed Times Square bombing The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incident Pakistani born American Faisal Shahzad said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs then returned to the U S to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U S forces overseas
3867,H: Must read when you can. Sid,H I m sure you are preoccupied with the adventures of Lula et al Nonetheless the article below just posted by the NY Review soon to be published is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact It s worth reading not least for Frank Luntz s poll numbers The hysterical tone of much of the Israeli leadership and US Jewish community is partly rooted in this long term and profound development Sid http www nybooks com articles archives jun failure american jewish establishment The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment by Peter Beinart E mail Single Page Share More by Peter Beinart anjamin Netanyahu drawing by Springs In several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish college students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel In response he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel Luntz found that they mostly didn t Six times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel he reported Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted Six times these Jewish youth used the word they rather than us to describe the situation That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising In recent years several studies have revealed in the words of Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and An Kelman of the University of California at that non Orthodox younger Jews on the whole feel much less attached to Israel than their elders with many professing a near total absence of positive feelings In the student senate at Brandeis the only nonsectarian Jewish sponsored university in America rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state Luntz s task was to figure out what had gone wrong When he probed the students views of Israel he hit up against some firm beliefs First they reserve the right to question the Israeli position These young Jews Luntz explained resist anything they see as group think They want an open and frank discussion of Israel and its flaws Second young Jews desperately want peace When Luntz showed them a series of ads one of the most popular was entitled Proof that Israel Wants Peace and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land Third some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair citing their own Muslim friends Most of the students in other words were liberals broadly defined They had imbibed some of the defining values of American Jewish political culture a belief in open debate a skepticism about military force a commitment to human rights And in their innocence they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and capable of peace and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs Luntz did not grasp the irony The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment has been working against for most of their lives Among American Jews today there are a great many Zionists especially in the Orthodox world people deeply devoted to the State of Israel And there are a great many liberals especially in the secular Jewish world people deeply devoted to human rights for all people Palestinians included But the two groups are increasingly distinct Particularly in the younger generations fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster indeed have actively opposed a Zionism that challenges Israel s behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens For several decades the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism s door and now to their horror they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead Morally American Zionism is in a downward spiral If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course they will wake up one day to find a younger Orthodox dominated Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them and a mass of secular American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled Saving liberal Zionism in the United States so that American Jews can help save liberal Zionism in Israel is the great American Jewish challenge of our age And it starts where Luntz s students wanted it to start by talking frankly about Israel s current government by no longer averting our eyes Since the s journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society In the words of Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi After decades of what came to be called a national consensus the Zionist narrative of liberation has dissolved openly contesting versions One version founded on a long memory of persecution genocide and a bitter struggle for survival is pessimistic distrustful of non Jews and believing only in Jewish power and solidarity Another nourished by secularized Versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment idea of progress articulates a deep sense of the limits of military force and a commitment to liberal democratic values Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide But in contemporary Israel the gulf is among the widest on earth As Ezrahi and others have noted this latter liberal democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism particularly among secular Israelis a greater demand for free expression and a greater skepticism of coercive authority You can see this spirit in new historians like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the human rights guarantees in Israel s Basic Laws You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak s apparent willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in and early But in Israel today this humane universalistic Zionism does not wield power To the contrary it is gasping for air To understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s government it s worth considering the case of Effi Eitam Eitam a charismatic ex cabinet minister and war hero has proposed ethnically cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank We ll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here and remove Israeli Arabs from the political system he declared in In Eitam merged his small Ahi Party Netanyahu s Likud And for the academic year he is Netanyahu s special emissary for overseas campus engagement In that capacity he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government s The group that organized his tour was called Caravan for Democracy Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam s views In his youth he briefly joined Meir Kahane s now banned Kach Party which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil Now Lieberman s position might be called pre expulsion He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won t swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish state He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel s Gaza war from running candidates for the Knesset He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed He wants to jail Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel You don t have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman s current views and his former ones The more you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection and the more you accuse them of treason the more thinkable a policy of expulsion becomes Lieberman s American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state What they usually fail to mention is that for him a two state solution means redrawing Israel s border so that a large chunk of Israeli Arabs find themselves exiled to another country without their consent Lieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu s first term as prime minister And when it comes to the West Bank Netanyahu s own record is in its way even more extreme than his prot g s In his book A Place among the Nations Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian In fact he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank he has declared would be a ghetto state with Auschwitz borders And the effort to gouge Judea and Samaria the West Bank out of Israel resembles Hitler s bid to wrench the German speaking Sudeten district from Czechoslovakia in It is unfair Netanyahu insists to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast gut wrenching concessions What kind of concessions It has abandoned its claim to Jordan which by rights should be part of the Jewish state On the left of Netanyahu s coalition sits Ehud Barak s emasculated Labor Party but whatever moderating potential it may have is counterbalanced by what is in some ways the most illiberal coalition partner of all Shas the ultra Orthodox party representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent At one point Shas like some of its Ashkenazi ultra Orthodox counterparts was open to dismantling settlements In recent years however ultra Orthodox Israelis anxious to find housing for their large families have increasingly moved to the West Bank where thanks to government subsidies it is far cheaper to live Not coincidentally their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise And they have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra Orthodox Judaism s profound hostility to liberal values Rabbi Ovadia Yosef Shas s immensely powerful spiritual leader has called Arabs vipers snakes and ants In after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip Yosef urged that God strike him down The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama an Islamic extremist Hebrew University Professor Ze ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op Ed in Haaretz he wrote The last time politicians holding views similar to theirs were in power in post World War II Western Europe was in Franco s Spain With their blessing a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order Sternhell should know In he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house Israeli governments come and go but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening long term trends in Israeli society an ultra Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically a settler movement that is growing more radical and more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to anti Arab racism In a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that percent of Jewish Israelis and percent of recent immigrants from the former USSR support encouraging Arabs to leave the country Attitudes are worst among Israel s young When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year Lieberman won This a poll found that percent of Jewish Israeli high school students and more than percent of religious Jewish high school students would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset An education ministry official called the survey a huge warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth You might think that such trends and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel s government would occasion substantial public concern even outrage among the leaders of organized American Jewry You would be wrong In Israel itself voices from the left and even center warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an apartheid state if it continues to hold the West Bank This when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of the occupation Shulamit Aloni former head of the dovish Meretz Party declared that Israel has not been democratic for some time now But in the United States groups like AIPAC and the Presidents Conference patrol public discourse scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn for peace The result is a terrible irony In theory mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism On its website AIPAC celebrates Israel s commitment to free speech and minority rights The Conference of Presidents declares that Israel and the United States share political moral and intellectual values including democracy freedom security and peace These groups would never say as do some in Netanyahu s coalition that Israeli Arabs don t deserve full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don t deserve human rights But in practice by defending virtually anything any Israeli government does they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very liberal values they profess to admire After Israel s elections last for instance Malcolm Hoenlein executive vice chairman of the Presidents Conference explained that Avigdor Lieberman s agenda was far more moderate than the media has presented it Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs Abraham Foxman national director of the Anti Defamation League told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that He s not saying expel them He s not saying punish them Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day evidently does not qualify as punishment The ADL has criticized anti Arab bigotry in the past and the American Jewish Committee to its credit warned that Lieberman s proposed loyalty oath would chill Israel s democratic political debate But the Forward summed up the overall response of America s communal Jewish leadership in its headline Jewish Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman s Role in Government Not only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government it tries to prevent others from leveling such criticism as well In recent years American Jewish organizations have waged a campaign to discredit the world s most respected international human rights groups In Foxman called an Amnesty International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians bigoted biased and borderline anti Semitic The Conference of Presidents has announced that biased NGOs include Amnesty International Human Rights Watch Christian Aid and Save the Children Last summer an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch has repeatedly demonstrated its anti Israel bias When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary Robinson former UN high commissioner for human rights the ADL and AIPAC both protested citing the fact that she had presided over the World Conference Against Racism in Durban South Africa Early drafts of the conference report implicitly accused Israel of racism Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge angering Syria and Iran Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions directing their outrage solely at Israel s neighbors they leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias Moreover while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply defending Israel from its foes they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist visions At the very moment the Anti Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an animus toward Israel an alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award Many of those groups like B Tselem which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human Rights have been at least as critical of Israel s actions in Lebanon Gaza and the West Bank as have Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch All of which raises an uncomfortable question If American Jewish groups claim that Israel s overseas human rights critics are motivated by anti Israeli if not anti Semitic bias what does that say about Israel s domestic human rights critics The implication is clear they must be guilty of self hatred if not treason American Jewish leaders don t generally say that of course but their allies in the Netanyahu government do Last summer Israel s vice prime minister Moshe Ya alon called the anti occupation group Peace Now a virus This a right wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel s Gaza war A Knesset member from Netanyahu s Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan head of the New Israel Fund which supports some of those human rights groups with treason and a member of Lieberman s party launched an investigation aimed at curbing foreign funding of Israeli NG s To their credit Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move which might have impaired their own work But they are reaping what they sowed If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel s government is motivated by animus toward the state or toward Jews in general you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst In the American Jewish establishment today the language of liberal Zionism with its idioms of human rights equal citizenship and territorial compromise has been drained of meaning It remains the lingua franca in part for generational reasons because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort They vote Democratic they are unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders and they are secular They don t want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left but neither do they want them to be agents of the Israeli right These American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up to the Six Day War when it appeared that Israel might be overrun and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War when much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state In that crucible Israel became their Jewish identity often in conjunction with the Holocaust which the and wars helped make central to American Jewish life These Jews embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics before the Lebanon war before the first intifada They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular less divided and less shaped by the culture politics and theology of occupation And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman the settlers and Shas American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally cohesive more innocent Israel of their youth an Israel that now only exists in their memories But these secular Zionists aren t reproducing themselves Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on Israel s border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States Instead they have grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power As a result they are more conscious than their parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals and less willing to grant Israel an exemption because its survival seems in peril Because they have inherited their parents liberalism they cannot embrace their uncritical Zionism Because their liberalism is real they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment is fake To sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism therefore America s Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to replenish their ranks They will need to find young American Jews who have come of age during the West Bank occupation but are not troubled by it And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the Orthodox world Because they marry earlier intermarry less and have more children Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of the American Jewish population According to a American Jewish Committee AJC survey while Orthodox Jews make up only percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty they constitute percent between the ages of eighteen and twenty four For America s Zionist organizations these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza In their yeshivas they learn devotion to Israel from an early age they generally spend a year of religious study there after high school and often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel The same AJC study found that while only percent of non Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel very close to Israel among the Orthodox the figure is percent As secular Jews drift away from America s Zionist institutions their Orthodox counterparts will likely step the breach The Orthodox are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns explains Heilman a sociologist at the City University of New York They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house so they now control the lights But it is this very parochialism a deep commitment to Jewish concerns which often outweighs more universal ones that gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast The AJC poll found that while percent of non Orthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state that figure drops to percent among the Orthodox In when Brandeis University s Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel he found Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal Even more tellingly Reform Conservative and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace but had been ill served by their leaders Orthodox Jews by contrast were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the enemy and to deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews Orthodox Judaism has great virtues including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in the American Jewish world I m biased since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue But if current trends continue the growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America s Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal democratic veneer that today covers American Zionism In America s major Jewish organizations sponsored a large Israel solidarity rally on the Washington Mall Up and down the east coast yeshivas shut down for the day swelling the estimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to percent When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz told the rally that innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well he was booed America s Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally Unless they change course it portends the future an American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish population that does not even feign concern for Israel My own children given their upbringing could as easily end up among the booers as among Luntz s focus group Either prospect fills me with dread In in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip Watching television a veteran Israeli commentator and politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the ruins of her home He said she reminded him of his grandmother In that moment Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life To begin with he watched In my experience there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today A Red Cross study on malnutrition in the Gaza Strip a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs an Israeli human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves three more Palestinian teenagers shot it s unpleasant Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game In a more recent report on how to foster Zionism among America s young Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word Arabs not Palestinians since the term Palestinians evokes images of refugee camps victims and oppression while Arab says wealth oil and Islam Of course Israel like the United States must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense But they are morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side Otherwise security justifies everything The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents Conference should ask themselves what Israel s leaders would have to do or say to make them scream no After all Lieberman is foreign minister Effi Eitam is touring American universities settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs barred from the Knesset If the line has not yet been crossed where is the line What infuriated critics about Lapid s comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz How dare he defile the memory of the Holocaust Of course the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others In the world of AIPAC the Holocaust analogies never stop and their message is always the same Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about themselves Many of Israel s founders believed that with statehood Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treated the non Jews living under their dominion For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared in and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews live with a minority But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the opposite since Jews are history s permanent victims always on the knife edge of extinction moral responsibility is a luxury Israel does not have Its only responsibility is to survive As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his remarkable book The Holocaust Is Over We Must Rise From Its Ashes Victimhood sets you free This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America s secular Jewish young It simply bears no relationship to their lived experience or what they have seen of Israel s Yes Israel faces threats from Hezbollah and Hamas Yes Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran But the dilemmas you face when you possess dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons and your adversary however despicable may acquire one are not the dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto The year is not as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed The drama of Jewish victimhood a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through or even strikes most of today s young American Jews as farce But there is a different Zionist calling which has never been more desperately relevant It has its roots in Israel s Independence Proclamation which promised that the Jewish state will be based on the precepts of liberty justice and peace taught by the Hebrew prophets and in the letter from Albert Einstein Hannah Arendt and others to The New York Times protesting right wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin s visit to the United States after his party s militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewish fortunes have radically changed the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use of Jewish power For several months now a group of Israeli students has been traveling every to the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty three years from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a permit and called traitors and self haters by the Israeli right the students keep coming their numbers now swelling the thousands What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel What if this was the face of Zionism shown to America s Jewish young What if the students in Luntz s focus group had been told that their generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish state on earth Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it writes Avraham Burg I was very comfortable there I know I was comfortable there too But comfortable Zionism has become a moral abdication Let s hope that Luntz s students in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah can foster an uncomfortable Zionism a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming and in love with what it still could be Let s hope

3868,H: also... Sid,You may have been alerted to this incident the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel His political views may be ridiculous or objectionable though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world but barring him for his political opinions has created a needless PR disaster not least for the US as he is after all a US citizen and a very prominent one internationally It is unfortunate on every level And the US should not be a passive onlooker He is a US citizen barred for his political views after all This story is splashed across the European press this morning Not what anyone needs yes yes like a hole in the head and bone stupid but the US effort on his to gain entry should be part of the story This incident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the future This is a downward slope bad news for everyone involved S pm Chomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel By ROBERT MACKEY Noam Chomsky an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel was denied entry the West Bank on by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver a lecture Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported No reason was initially given for the decision but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky s intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel Chomsky who is on a speaking tour in the region was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on A spokeswoman for Israel s interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and officials were trying to get clearance from the Israeli military which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter In a television interview from Amman Jordan after he was rebuffed Mr Chomsky told Al Jazeera English the facts were completely clear to everyone there was no basis for a misunderstanding He explained that he was interrogated for several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross the occupied Palestinian territory The year old scholar added I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation he was receiving instructions from the Israeli ministry of interior and relaying them There were two basic points One was that the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say which puts them the category of I suppose every other government in the world The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an invitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities as I have done many times in the past but not this time Mr Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the Palestinian university in Ramallah The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza which ended in and has criticized Israel s occupation of Palestinian territory many times In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in Mr Chomsky said I objected to the founding of Israel as a Jewish state I don t think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept I would object to the United States as a Christian state When Ms Solomon pressed Mr Chomsky on his opposition to Israel saying Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar and sometimes you sound like a self hating Jew he replied It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti Semites or self hating Jews It s grotesque If an Italian criticized Italian policies would he be seen as a self hating Italian Copyright The New York Times Company Privacy Policy NYTimes com Eighth Avenue New York NY

3928,FW: SRB op-ed in Wash Post Outlook section Sunday,HRC Below is an oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow s Outlook Unfortunately they give it a horrible title but I think the piece turned out alright Best By R R chair of the global strategy firm Stonebridge Group served as national security advisor to President Clinton from to President Obama s National Security Strategy released by the White House on tackles a delicate but unavoidable question How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and a reordering of political power abroad For some time now it has been clear that the definition of U S national security strategy needs rethinking The attacks global economic crisis cyber terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf underscore that the challenges America faces in have changed even from just a decade ago And while America s military supremacy is certainly not at risk new international arrangements such as the shift from the G club of powerful nations to the G which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil are needed so that the costs and benefits of a stable international order are shared The United States cannot solve most global threats without others nor should we bear the burden alone Enter the National Security Strategy In my experience these congressionally mandated documents can easily become laborious and impenetrable or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government Make sure you do right by Japan Don t step on the Pentagon The challenge which President Clinton insisted upon to me and his other advisers is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs administration decision makers up and down the line It s not a blueprint for action but a means to convey the president s principles and priorities In Obama s case the new sober and comprehensive page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with past strategies in several key respects But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges nuclear proliferation terrorism and regional conflicts for which the best response is a return to fundamentals One such fundamental is the strength of our economy At a time when the after effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America the administration makes a case for economic and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U S security The president made this case in his West Point speech last weekend At no time in human history he said has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained its military and political primacy Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia the president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration And by convening a global summit on securing nuclear material this spring Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort started in when Sens Sam Nunn and Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials On terrorism the strategy builds on the past but breaks with it as well Presidents Clinton Bush and Obama each have deployed all of America s tools military power homeland defense law enforcement sanctions intelligence and vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge This is not a global war against a tactic terrorism or a religion Islam the new strategy says We are at war with a specific network al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein s Iraq In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor the Obama administration has restored a less provocative policy on the use of military force In the national security strategy President Bush articulated the rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U N resolution to invade Iraq The new strategy restores the principles that have guided administrations for decades the use of force should be a last resort should weigh all the costs and benefits and should have as much international support as possible The administration reserves the right to act unilaterally for example against al Qaeda and its allies but resurrects the principle President Clinton often described as together where possible alone where necessary President Obama s critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea The President sets forth his rationale to create opportunities to resolve differences strengthen the international community s support for our actions learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes and plainly demonstrate to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation In the case of Iran Washington s outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran s compliance But attempts to engage have helped ensure that the world s attention is focused on Iran s intransigence rather than Washington s refusal to negotiate Without a doubt there are gaps between principle and practice Despite the Obama administration s stated goal of doubling exports in the next five years it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea Panama and Colombia And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities Sixteen months this administration there has been much progress but many of the true tests of this strategy lie ahead In the strategy s conclusions the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era calling for both political parties to restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War Despite the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control Central America and d tente nearly all American supported the containment of communism In that same spirit the administration s framework deserves broad bipartisan support We can and should argue out our differences over detention of prisoners methods to disarm dangerous states how hard to push for democratic rights or the costs of climate change legislation But at the same time we can rally around the overriding U S foreign policy goals spelled out in the strategy renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad defeating al Qaeda succeeding in Afghanistan preventing nuclear proliferation curbing climate change and promoting an international order of enlightened self interest economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based

3937,"H: this report appeared in Maariv, major Israeli daily, on May 27, fyi, Sid",Netanyahu pleased I didn t capitulate Ben Caspit Maariv page with front page lead Hebrew original here and at bottom of post In the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said according to his interlocutors that he managed to defeat the US administration Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed so he said to twist his arm and that ultimately in the duel between him and the Obama administration he was the one who emerged with the upper hand We did not make concessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn t want to go said Netanyahu according to people who heard him speak Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze which is due to expire in According to senior officials in Jerusalem an agreement has already been reached with the administration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories and the Americans will make sure that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks Israel however will not take aggressive action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs The Prime Minister s Bureau vigorously denied the above report The statements attributed to the prime minister are incorrect said a spokesman in the Prime Minister s Bureau They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum The reason is simple the prime minister does not think that Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the commitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel s security and their efforts to renew the peace process in our region Eli Bardenstein adds The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week might attest to a radical change in the White House s attitude towards him Political sources in Israel described the planned meeting as the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama administration in the past number of weeks The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli Palestinian conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem and to mend the mistaken impression that was received as if Israel was no longer an absolute ally of the United States That crisis which was initiated by the Americans elicited fierce criticism in the United States and sparked a desire among members of the Obama administration to rectib the situation Another reason for the administration s desire to end the crisis is the fear offailure in the upcoming Congressional elections in The Democratic Party s coffers are empty Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to continue they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections said one source in Washington The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two months ago This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture taken together and to give statements to the media That said sources in Washington noted that Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking a trap once again He knows that the smiles notwithstanding behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very difficult questions like how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel s acceptance the OECD The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike which is liable to impede his movement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings

3954,"H: Advance copy, to be published Monday. Sid",Published on The New Republic http www tnr com The Unnecessary Fall A counter history of the Obama presidency B Judis I am On as Barack Obama s standing in the polls was beginning to slip and as Tea Party demonstrators were amassing in Washington for tax day protests the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the five pillars of his economic policies The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama s program that would evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt s Square Deal Franklin Roosevelt s New Deal and Lyndon Johnson s Great Society Obama s contribution was to be the New Foundation We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest he declared Obama would repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months At Obama s private White House dinner with presidential historians that the historians were no more impressed than the public with the New Foundation as a slogan I don t think it s going to work Dallek warned Doris Kearns Goodwin said it sounded like a woman s girdle One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a Democratic president once before In his State of the Union address Jimmy Carter began Tonight I want to examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous world Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech including in its conclusion where he asked members of Congress to join him in building that new foundation Like Obama s effort the phrase inspired at most a few underwear jokes and was then forgotten Obama s evocation of Carter was obviously unintended but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over his presidency Of course Obama has already accomplished more in his first months than Jimmy Carter did during his entire presidency But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies Both men ran inspired campaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and initially stirred hopes of a transformational presidency But as presidents both men somehow failed to connect with large parts of the electorate To be sure there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble Both men contended with rising unemployment Carter with rampant inflation as well and voters approval of a president and his party tend to track closely with changes in the economy Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful business lobby and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post partisan presidency Yet the most important reason for their difficulties evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs has been an inability to develop a politics that resonates with the public In the United States politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class even as its identity has changed from yeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks office workers x ray technicians and small business owners They are in Bill Clinton s words those who work hard and play by the rules They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric that goes back to the early republic It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below impoverished immigrants welfare cheaters ghetto rioters or above Wall Street speculators state bureaucrats K Street lobbyists Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin It is intrinsically neither left wing nor right wing Politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan who found a way of using populism s appeal during downturns have enjoyed success while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly If in circumstances like the present one you don t develop a populist politics your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people That s what Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late s And that s what has happened in the last months of the Great Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads Obama took office with widespread popular support even among Republicans and some of his first efforts including the billion stimulus initially enjoyed strong public favor But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of Disillusion with Obama fueled the defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia By it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown s astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in Massachusetts In the postmortem debate over these defeats some Democrats have blamed Obama s dogged pursuit of health care reform while the economy was hemorrhaging jobs That may have been a factor but the real damage was done earlier What doomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency In an atmosphere primed for a populist backlash he allowed the right wing to define the terms As Obama was delivering his inaugural address the financial crisis was already in full swing and it was already apparent that financial speculation outright fraud and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing loan practices had played a very large role in precipitating the crisis The public was up in arms But instead of rallying the public against the money changers as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural Obama taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter s infamous malaise speech put the blame on the public as a whole Our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age he declared Over the next month Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations at various times calling the bonuses they gave themselves shameful and an outrage but after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the bankers he would back off At a private meeting on with Wall Street CEOs the president his spokesman Gibbs said emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street And in his Georgetown speech Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility The recession Obama said was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street Obama s policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric One week he would favor harsh restrictions on bank and insurance company bonuses but the next week he would waver one week he would support legislation allowing bankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks the next week he would fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions But more importantly Obama in sharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or even to set up a commission to investigate fraud When Congress finally appointed a commission in Obama and his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician former California State Treasurer Angelides in charge of it Obama s appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook He appointed Timothy Geithner to be treasury secretary Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street but in his capacity as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon As New York Fed president Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go under for the unpopular tarp program and for American International Group MG paying back its Wall Street creditors with government money Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs Retiring Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan told me Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts and the administration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street By the spring Obama s apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right wing populist revolt in the country The newly formed Tea Party movement Beck and Fox News and a host of right wing bloggers were leading the charge but in a less extreme form the general public shared their anger In an early New York Times CBS News poll the public disapproved of Obama s aiding the banks by percent to percent In this same poll public approval of Obama s handling of the economy began to fall Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama s economic policies to his handling of the financial crisis Congressman Barney Frank who defends Obama s policies acknowledges that the president s political difficulties began with the revelation that MG which had received billion from the government had paid out billion in bonuses to the division that had brought the company down Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were no legal grounds to block them It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses The pitchforks were out It added injury to injury Frank says That s when public opinion of Geithner plummeted According to a Rasmussen poll percent had a favorable view of Geithner and percent an unfavorable one The public s view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout the stimulus and health care reform One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was where s my bailout Obama himself acknowledged that it was one of the most frequent questions he was asked in letters The auto program became a bailout for the Big Three CEOs the stimulus became a bailout of government itself and health care reform was a bailout for the uninsured or reparations as Rush Limbaugh put it Wrote right wing blogger Michelle Malkin hardworking citizens were getting sick of being played for chumps by moochers big and small corporate and individual trampling over themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayed as aiding the moochers but not the hardworking citizens In American politics that s a recipe for political disaster Some in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration s economic efforts were being defined by right wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack A group within the White House began calling themselves the pitchfork gang but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get tough on Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head Larry Summers who were worried about upsetting business confidence There was a continual tension in the White House says a person who was privy to the discussions One week we would be very hot and then the next week we would dial it back By early of this year Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class According to a CNN poll percent of Americans thought Obama had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions than to the problems faced by middle class Americans Only percent barely more than a quarter thought he had paid more attention to the middle class As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls the White House temporarily embraced a populist approach On Obama called the bank bonuses obscene and said we want our money back In a speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria Ohio a far cry from Georgetown Obama used the word fighting times and fight nine times I will not stop fighting for you he declared But faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street Obama once again turned conciliatory On io he said that he didn t begrudge the million bonus awarded to Dimon and the million to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein I know both guys They are very savvy businessmen Obama s reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered down financial reform bill or even no bill at all but on the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud The next week an emboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their failure of responsibility As a result of the indictment and Obama s rediscovery of his anger Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist moderate Republicans broke with the party s leadership and moderate Democrats fell line Congress produced a much stronger bill than the Democrats had ever expected But Obama s embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic After the U S Chamber of Commerce and Verizon s Ivan Seidenberg the head of the Business Roundtable criticized Obama for being anti business in the president dispatched Geithner White House aide Valerie Jarrett and Bill Clinton to appease the business community Obama has said enough to anger the CEOs but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them Obama s unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable along with his delayed and muddled response to the BP disaster in the Gulf has eroded the public s confidence in his leadership In Pew s midyear report card on Obama s image the greatest drop from to this was in the perception of Obama as a strong leader Voters will sometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like Kennedy or Reagan whom they regard as strong but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter whom they regard as weak What of the other factors behind Obama s political difficulties There is no doubt that if the economy were growing faster and if unemployment were dropping below percent Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a rout But unfortunately the economy s sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the White House s weak political performance In when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose Romer the head of the Council of Economic Advisors proposed a trillion Keynesian jolt Obey the chairman of the House Budget Committee told The Fiscal Times that Obama s Treasury Department asked initially for a trillion bill But the administration finally proposed a stimulus between and billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulate saving than consumption and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama s first term In the stimulus s first year the administration spent only billion of the billion allocated for infrastructure spending Prominent economists including Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz made the case that a much larger stimulus was necessary to reverse rather than merely reduce the rise in unemployment and that if a modest stimulus failed to reduce unemployment Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additional Keynesian measures That argument has been proven sadly correct Some White House advisers appear to have underestimated the depth of the Great Recession Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political clout to get more from Congress But the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency which it was framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators short sighted CEOs and Chinese mercantilism and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists When Obama belatedly made this sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated So it s not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus which has ended up hurting the administration politically wasn t itself a result of political timidity The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he thought it could accomplish Obama s New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten Afterward Obama to the dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides pretty much dropped the jobs issue From then to Labor Day he devoted a visit to Buffalo and an stopover in southern Indiana to the issue at a time when the right wing was mobilizing against him Obama didn t just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy he didn t really try Contrast Obama s attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in Faced with steadily rising unemployment which went from percent in to percent in Reagan and his political staff which included Baker Mike Deaver and Ed Rollins forged a strategy early that year calling for voters to stay the course and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy We are clearing away the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps Reagan declared Democrats accused them of playing the blame game but the strategy followed to the letter by the White House for ten months worked The Republicans were predicted to lose as many as House seats but they lost only and broke even in the Senate Some commentators have noted Reagan s popularity was even lower than Obama s But on key economic questions he did much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing and voters expressed far greater patience with Reagan s program According to polls even as the unemployment rate climbed a narrow plurality still expressed confidence that Reagan s program would help the economy On the eve of the election with the unemployment rate at a postwar high a New York Times CBS News poll found that o percent of likely voters thought Reagan s economic program would eventually help the country That s a sign of a successful political operation If Obama could command those numbers Democrats could seriously limit their losses in But Obama has not been able to develop a narrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its The principal culprit is clearly Barack Obama He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics His aversion is strange because he was schooled in it working as a community organizer in the os under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings of the radical Saul Alinsky But when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in he left Alinsky and adversarial tactics behind The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in practiced a very different style of politics Obama s principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring videotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases He was not a typical blue collar bread and butter Chicago Democrat but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city seeing in politics a higher calling and ill at ease with although not in open opposition to the city s Democratic machine He was also a post racial politician who eschewed the hard edged angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson That too is oddly reminiscent of Carter who partly campaigned in as the white Southern antidote to Wallace s angry racial populism Obama carried this outlook the U S Senate his campaign for the presidency and then the presidency itself He is a cerebral dispassionate post partisan he wants to end the political strategy that has been based on division to turn the page on the culture wars of the s and the partisan battles of the s During the campaign his aides jokingly referred to him as the black Jesus While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict he is reluctant to actively foment it In a time of crisis we can t afford to govern out of anger he declared in During his campaign and his first year in office he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his legislation He is perhaps ill suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations In the campaign they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of hope and change and have extended this strategy the presidency itself They see him as standing above party In a meeting with congressional leaders last senior adviser rejected the complaint that Obama accorded equal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the cynical politics in Washington Within the White House top aides still speak of promoting the Obama brand Organizing for America the administration s campaign organization which is supposed to be focusing on the elections recently devoted its resources to organizing parties across the country to celebrate Obama s forty ninth birthday These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly burly of Washington politics have been disastrous Obama s image as an iconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News the Tea Party radicalright bloggers and assorted politicians have projected the image of him as a foreigner an Islamic radical and a socialist He has remained the other that he aspired to be during the campaign but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism As Jonathan Alter recounts in The Promise President Obama Year One Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall Street on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers For most of his first year Alter writes Obama bought the Geithner Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn t be confronted while they remained in peril Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically making it far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery and Democrats political prospects Bad politics can trump good policy Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview It tends toward demagoguery In its relentless focus on the middle class it can ignore or stigmatize those below it It can prove hostile to a long range scientific outlook A more populist Obama for instance might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and probably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration But populism has been an indelible part of the American political psyche and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals like Hoover or Carter or more recently presidential candidate Kerry suffer the consequences at the polls If Obama s politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress and even to a Republican president in then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone It s unlikely that a new Republican president and Congress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill But the former could be starved of public funds and deprived of regulatory oversight and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or hostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform That is where politics has to come in and that s where the Obama administration with its aversion to populism has fallen short B Judis is a senior editor of The New Republic and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment

3964,"Max's new epilogue to paperback edition of ""Republican Gomorrah"": The Right's Days",of Rage Days of Rage The Noxious Transformation of the Conservative Movement a Rabid Fringe By Max Nation Books Posted on Printed on http www alternet orgistory Editor s Note The following is the new epilogue from Max s book Republic Gomorrah now out in paperback Basic Nation Books He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself Since the Republic is weak he is led to break the law out of love for obedience But is it really strong authority that he wishes In reality he demands rigorous order for others and for himself disorder without responsibility Jean Sartre Anti Semite and Jew I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Obama era It might have been early on in when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada Perusing tables piled high with high caliber semi automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity I heard urgent warnings of mass roundups concentration camps and a socialist government in Washington These people that are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what s going on in this country a gun dealer told me outside a show in Reno Good luck Obama a young gun enthusiast remarked to me We outnumber him to At this time the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media s radar In I led a panel discussion about this book inside an auditorium filled with nearly students and faculty at the University of California Riverside Beside me sat Jonathan Walton an African American professor of religious studies and prolific writer and Mark Takano an erudite openly gay former Democratic congressional candidate and local community college trustee In the middle of our discussion a dozen College Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a left wing hack while a hysterical young man leaped from the crowd blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a racist Afterward university police officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right wing heckler attempted to follow me as he shouted threats Who was this stalker Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit the Intercollegiate Studies Institute Besides founding dozens of Republican youth groups across the country Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in homosexuals His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax arguing that homosexuality is at once a curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists Adding to his credentials Sorba has a history of run ins with the law he explained when I called him about the order My encounter with this aggressive right wing cadre seemed a strange isolated event But the hostility turned out to be symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimize President Obama and his allies in Congress The Right s days of rage were only beginning Through his first year in office Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right He campaigned against partisanship declaring that there were no red states and no conservative America Apparently he thought it was merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science demonized gays assailed minority and women s rights or that they genuinely believed in what they said Speaking of changing Washington Obama seemed to think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Reagan and the Right and their strategies of polarization was not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain divisive personalities easily wiped away with gestures toward bipartisanship His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but separated by partisans The skilled and devoted community organizer could bring them together Many of his supporters in the media often part and parcel of political wars over the years reinforced and amplified his innocence proclaiming he was the one at last who could bridge the partisan divide a disaffected conservative who once called critics of W Bush policies fifth columnists but now fervently supporting Obama wrote that the new president was destined to become a liberal Reagan who can reunite America This optimism pervaded the Obama White House as the president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programs After all why couldn t we all just get along In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views Once he was elected conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama s strength by transforming him a human tableau for the most fearsome images they could conjure Obama s multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock troops Those who rejected Obama s legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the Birther movement that sought to challenge his citizenship The movement s most visible figure and therefore the most eccentric was Orly Taitz a dentist and self trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling in the conservative bastion of Orange County California Convinced by claims on the far right Web site WorldNetDaily that Obama planned to create a civilian national security force Taitz told me she realized that Obama was another Stalin it s a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler s Germany After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama s family had forged his birth certificate in Hawaii Taitz snapped action She filed a lawsuit in with California Secretary of State Debra Bowen demanding an investigation Obama s eligibility to serve as president Taitz s plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake an Orange County radio preacher and former second vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly prayed for Obama s death While her lawsuit went nowhere and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges Taitz became an instant media sensation delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers from Sean Haimity to CNN s Lou Dobbs who Taitz called her greatest supporter and who was eventually fired as an indirect result of his hosting of her In Texas Rep Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign The Birther movement had found its voice in goverment and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots By percent of Republican respondents to a Kos Research poll said they thought Obama wasn t born in the United States while percent weren t sure Obama should be in the Big House Taitz shrieked to me not the White House When Obama announced health care reform as the first major initiative of his administration the conservative movement activated a campaign of demonization transformational politics designed to turn Obama the Other making him seem as unfamiliar and therefore as threatening as possible When the president urged the Congress to deliver a health care reform bill in the Right staged a living theater of political hatred Obama s dream of bipartisanship transformed a nightmarish version of Marat Sade On tens of thousands of far right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on Washington s National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama health care plan The date was significant Fox News s top ranked talk show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the Project to restore the sense of unity and siege mentality that Americans experienced on But this time Obama not Osama was the enemy While covering the rally I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America s security than al Qaida demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama s face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden others carried signs questioning Obama s status as a U S citizen We can fight al Qaida we can t kill Obama said an aging demonstrator Another told me Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world pointing to placards he had fashioned depicting Obama and House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits According to another activist Obama s agenda was similar to Hitler s Hitler took over the banking industry did he not And Hitler had his own personal secret service police The community organizing group ACORN is an extension of that The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right wing Jewish settlers during rallies against Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process portraying him as an SS officer and as the French collaborator Petain In amid the provocative atmosphere a young right wing Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence Members of the Tea Party Patriots did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational or that comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic Their motives were entirely negative By purging government of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means several activists told me they believed ACORN helped Obama steal the election they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return They had no interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda much less discussing the merits of policies The Tea Party s primary concern was cultural purification freedom from not freedom to Against the dark image of the president and his liberal allies Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light The racial subtext was always transparent The Tea Party s strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported health care reform The Tea Partiers were convinced this would be an easy feat since they believed the majority of the country was on their side that they represented the Real America At the rally Matt Kibbe one of the march organizers told the crowd that ABC News was reporting that million to million people were in attendance something ABC denied saying ABCNews com reported an approximate figure of to protesters Then Armey led the crowd in a chant of Freedom works Freedom works Unknown to most of the Tea Partiers they were intoning the name of a corporate funded Beltway advocacy group not the battle cry of Mel Gibson Wallace in Braveheart Contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilized to stifle the machinations of Washington elites the Tea Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry funded conservative groups with close Republican ties The movement s leading puppet master was Dick Armey who directed resources and talking points to the Tea Party Patriots from his Washington D C based advocacy group FreedomWorks Among the corporate clients of Armey s lobbying firm which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties was the pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb a company with a clear interest in defeating health care reform Armey s other real American clients included the Marxist terror cult People s Mojahedin of Iran which received funding and assistance from Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the s against Iranian civilian targets Armey collected a consulting fee of directly from FreedomWorks and from allied astroturf front groups FreedomWorks paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants If Armey was the Tea Party king Sarah PalM was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen Just days after Obama s inauguration Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honor PalM s motives for quitting became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue signed on as a regular contributor to Fox News and received million an episode for a reality show on cable television Sarah Palin s Alaska PalM s book tour which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus resembled both a presidential campaign and a traveling carnival Whether or not PalM intends to run for president her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the Republican Party Yet the ever expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos desperately seeking to expand the party s base after the drubbing in Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt warned that Palin s nomination in would be catastrophic for the GOP His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll revealing her as one of the most polarizing and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over percent Unfortunately for Schmidt and other party pragmatists those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party its most fervent activists and cannot be dissuaded from following her even if she is leading the party off a cliff A special congressional election in New York s heavily Republican rd district was the first major test of Palin s power Along with a parade of nationally recognized conservatives Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman an unknown far right third party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party helping to force a popular moderate Republican politician Dede Scozzafava from the race In the end Palin s ideological purge in upstate New York led to an improbable Democratic victory the first in that district in more than years After the disaster Palin and her allies claimed victory insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party She went on to endorse Rand the son of right wing libertarian Rep Ron and a candidate in Kentucky s GOP senatorial primary while Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand s regular Republican opponent Trey Grayson the Kentucky secretary of state Following the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian Right within the movement s ranks the self described hardcore pro lifer Palin recast herself as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of economic freedom She claimed the Democratic cap and trade plan to limit carbon emissions would harm the livelihood of blue collar workers and she assailed health care reform as a Trojan Horse for socialism though she admitted her family used to hustle over the border to take advantage of Canada s single payer health care system But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama health care plan included a provision for death panels that would recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome afflicted son Trig With the click of a button Palin transformed the tone of the health care debate from rancorous to poisonous The source of Palin s death panels smear was a practiced propagandist former New York Lieutenant Governor McCaughey When President Bill Clinton introduced health care reform during his first term McCaughey falsely claimed in an article published in the New Republic and widely circulated by Republicans that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy the government s program the article would go on to win a National Magazine Award and then be retracted years later by the New Republic s editors Now she was back in the spotlight pushing a rumor that would be voted by the non partisan fact checking Web site Politifact com as the lie of McCaughey s latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche which mobilized to push the rumor the mainstream In one of LaRouche s top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel the National Institute of Health s chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler s T program to kill the handicapped through health care reform President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in that began the genocide there LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin charged Soon LaRouche s followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a Hitler moustache At a town hall forum on health care reform hosted by Democratic Rep Barney Frank a LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama as Hitler posters and demanded Why do you continue to support a Nazi policy as Obama has expressly supported this policy Two months later after Palin whispered the rumor on Facebook prominent conservatives from former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate Finance Committee member Charles Grassley parroted her claims before audiences of indignant Tea Partiers Not to be outdone Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death panels Echoing the LaRouche cultists Beck accused Ezekiel Emanuel of the devaluing of human life putting a price on each individual He thundered The death panel is not a firing squad Rationing is inevitable and they know it The death panel rumor served a variety of functions all useful to the movement but not necessarily to the Republican Party Most importantly the rumor resonated both with hard core libertarians who resented the very existence of the federal government and Christian Right activists who viewed the legalization of abortion as a slippery slope to government sponsored euthanasia The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in when the evangelical conservative Dobson publicly clashed with Armey the libertarian leader over the right of the government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper agent crypto Muslim helped bring the neoconservatives back the fray The new neo con generation was led by Dick Cheney s daughter Liz who founded an anti Obama advocacy group Keep America Safe by leveraging donations from pro Israel sources Asked by CNN s Larry King about the Birther movement that was challenging Obama s status as an American citizen Liz Cheney remarked One of the reasons you see people so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever I think a president who seems so reluctant to defend the nation overseas With the libertarians Christian Right and the neo cons seated around the same table united in resentment of the alien president the conservative movement was whole again The experiments in Terror Management Theory of Sheldon Solomon professor of psychology at Skidmore College Jeff Greenberg professor of psychologist at the Unviersity of Arizona and Tom Pyszczynski professor of psychology at the University of Colorado have demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes The findings help explain the effectiveness of the death panel rumor and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists Indeed these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical reasoning calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality Whether or not Independents responded the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage ensuring a standing army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance Obama s first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests there were several disturbing murders committed by far right extremists In a year old neo Nazi wannabe named Poplawsi mowed down a SWAT team of Pittsburgh cops killing three Poplawski s best friend told reporters the young killer grew angry recently over fears Obama would outlaw guns Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video clip to a neo Nazi Web site portraying Fox s Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration camps After a characteristically thorough investigation Beck conceded they were not real On another occasion the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party rallies A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath Scott Roeder a supporter of the militant anti abortion group Operation Rescue shot Dr Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita Kansas Tiller was declared fair game by the anti abortion movement because of his role as Kansas s only late term abortion provider During at least episodes of Bill O Reilly s O Reilly Factor O Reilly had referred to Tiller as Tiller the baby killer a criminal guilty of Nazi stuff I wouldn t want to be Tiller if there is a Judgment Day O Reilly proclaimed In a middle aged professional named Sodini walked a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and gunned down three women The mainstream press explained Sodini s motives away by homing in on passages in his online diaries describing his loneliness inability to convince women to have sex with him and descent chronic masturbation Nearly every major media outlet omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual frustration onto Obama whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation The day after Obama s election victory Sodini wrote Good luck to Obama He will be successful The liberal media LOVES him Amerika has chosen The Black Man Good In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama s plans for the economy and such Here it is Every black man should get a young white girl Kinda a reverse indentured servitude thing Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college she be real good I saw it Not my little girl daddy says Yeah right Black dudes have thier sic choice of best white ellipses in original In another posting to an anti Clinton forum in during the height of the Republicans Whitewater investigation Sodini revealed that he had purchased a bumper sticker reading Stop Socialism Impeach Clinton from a National Review ad A year later Sodini ranted on an anti government militia site I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring the country back to the Constitutional order that it was years ago I don t think any group of political leaders will achieve this for us Whether or not Sodini s murder spree was motivated by his political passions he was pathologically death driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right wing imagery In his final diary entry Sodini proclaimed Death lives More than any other media figure of the Obama era Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonization and conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party Patriots During a broadcast of Fox and Friends Beck opined that Obama has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep seated hatred for white people or the white culture As evidence Beck pointed to White House green jobs czar Van an African American former community organizer who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck s crusade From there Beck targeted another black Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett highlighting her ties to ACORN while upholding her and as evidence of Obama s socialist agenda In another broadcast Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African Americans referring to Obama money as they collected welfare checks in Detroit Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City based youth group practicing a step show a traditional African American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that Obama s SS was being trained across inner city America In Beck relentlessly targeted ACORN the Right s new favorite hobgoblin admitting that he intended to use the poor people s advocacy group to distract his viewers from the health care debate Trust me Beck said Everybody now says they re going to be talking about health care I don t think so His statement was reminiscent of Rush Limbaugh s scandal mongering remark during the early Clinton administration Whitewater is about health care Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden camera videos shot by conservative youth activists O Keefe and Hannah Giles inside ACORN field offices In the videos O Keefe baited African American staffers making statements explaining that Giles who claimed she was a prostitute could obtain low income housing O Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with ACORN however Giles later admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to farther ineriminate ACORN In the end ACORN was exonerated of all criminal wrongdoing while in a separate incident O Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone lines in the office of Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana Like Ryan Sorba O Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well funded conservative outfits O Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute the right wing youth Froup that nurtured leadinG lights like Jack Abriunoff Karl Rove Ralph Reed and Jeff Gannon While O Keefe and his buddies plea bargained with prosecutors Beck basked in his formula for success His show earned the hithest ratings at Fox News topping network franchises like O Reilly and Sean Hannity In the process Beck s opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists Glenn Beck has taught us everything we know a demonstrator at the rally told Me He s opened our eyes to so much But unlike the right wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gin trich s Republican counter revolution of Beck was not an authentic product of the movement When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves Beck was mired in the world of mid level commercial radio delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in hopes of becoming the next Howard Stem By night as he has tirelessly recounted he medicated his anxiety with cocaine and alcohol destroying his first marriage in the process We remember Glenn from the womanizing the drinking the drugs Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was a shock jock from Tampa Florida who called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show Like Dusty Rhodes the pseudo populist demagogue of Elia Kazan s film A Face in the Crowd Beck was a self destructive drifter Who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog in an alleyway or been locked away in a prison cell had fame not found him first Beck was only able to stabilize his life when he made his escape from freedom marrying a conservative Mormon converting to her religion and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs conservative radio diatribes When Beck first broke television On CNN s Headline News Channel he struggled to articulate a coherent political world view If he distinguished himself from other big time conservative hosts in any way he did so through strained and often snide attempts at humor remnants of his failed radio career Nevertheless with help from his liberal agent Matthew Hiltzik Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early Around this same time Beck began promoting the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy peddler named W Clean Skousen whom he described as his political lodestar Suddenly Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures Thanks to Beck s designation of Skousen s pseudohistorical tract The Year Leap as required reading on the Web site of his Project and his promotion of the book on his show the previously obscure Skousen became the Hidden imam of the Tea Party movement By the summer of Skousen s Leap was among the top books on Amazon com and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in to selling over copies in Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand It is little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified to explain why America is the greatest nation in history in the process Skousen claims that church and state separation is un American that coercive taxation is communist and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society Benjamin Franklin who wrote at length on the merits of amours with old women and who famously solicited prostitutes and fathered a son of out of wedlock was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world s foremost source of eternal wisdom he buttressed his points with fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd s screeds about the Illuminati According to Skousen Dodd claimed that powerful influences congregating in the United States like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United States World War I Skousen published Dodd s manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen s Digest which he founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies Skousen s paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti communist groups during the s He boasted of a close friendship with then FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist plots claims disputed by FBI historians During a recent interview Skousen s son told me that contrary to rumors of Hoover s cross dressing and homosexual dalliances he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City s police chief for in the words of the city s conservative Mormon mayor conduct ing hi s office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government From there Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the Right peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist and earning condemnation from his beloved FBI which accused him in an internal memo of promoting his own anti communism for obvious financial purposes Skousen s vocal support for the far right Birch Society s claim that communists controlled President Dwight Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red bashing lecture tours He went off the radar for several years returning during the late s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil rights movement By the late s even the Church of Latter Day Saints distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared entirely had Beck not revived it turning The Year Leap the bible of the Tea Party movement Journalist Alexander Zaitchik observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon com that Skousen s renewed influence through Beck and the Tea Party suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place Besides influencing Beck Skousen s teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement s most visible grassroots celebrities retired Sheriff Mack I met Mack in at a far right rally just outside of Montgomery Alabama On a makeshift stage towed the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck Mack recalled with reverence his mentorship by Skousen who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the Constitution Mack urged his spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food If you control the food supply Mack warned you control the people And that s the first step to slavery Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal background checks of gun purchasers Mack reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government Along with a few dozen former and active military and law enforcement personnel Mack helped form a self styled Tea Party militia called the Oathkeepers Galvanized by their fear of creeping socialism the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans concentration camps Because the group s members trained for combat the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance Besides Mack the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia movement retreads its ranks The most well established figure was Mike Vanderboegh a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid s entitled Strategy and Tactics for a Militia Civil War calling for sniper attacks on war criminals secret policemen rats With Obama in office Vandeboegh churned out anti government screeds on right wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by cashing in the in federal disability compensation he received each month For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama s agenda it was a Democrat who posed the greatest threat to the passage of health care reform Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since placing him among the senior leadership of the so called centrist Blue Dog Democrats When health care reform was introduced in Congress Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti abortion Democrats making him the de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill By extension Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low income women But after close consultation with leaders of the U S Conference of Catholic Bishops Stupak went a step further He introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance plans The amendment which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate became a key sticking point in health care negotiations He s a big hero now in the pro life community former Bush Catholic issues adviser Deal Hudson told me in Thanks to him this is the first time I can remember the pro life Democrats having any power To the chagrin of the Republicans Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership According to Hudson the Catholic Bishops were keen to see health care reform pass but only if the bill contained a clear provision forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion Finally in after pressure from House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi Obam a agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion Stupak had been mollified Now he and his anti abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill As soon as reports seeped out declaring the imminent passage of health care reform major right wing blogs like RedState org churned out virulent denunciations of Stupak calling him a traitor and sellout The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr Tiller Bart the Baby Killer On thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol s Longworth Building in expectation of Obama s pep talk to the House Democrats and the health care vote Democratic john a hero of the civil rights movement and Barney Frank the first openly gay member of Congress passed through the crowd on their way inside the Capitol Thsligger a demonstrator barked at Another called Frank a faggot eliciting laughter and cheers from nearby protesters Meanwhile as another African American Democrat Emanuel Cleaver ascended the Capitol steps a protester who had been screaming at and Frank spat on his face With the demonstration carried on the night cries of Kill the bill drifted calls for violence I would gladly stand with any of you men here and take these fascists down a man in camouflage battle dress uniform proclaimed in front of an amateur videographer pointing toward the Capitol You haven t heard the last of me The next day Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Partiers The demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside Finally after hours of impassioned speeches on the House floor the bill passed But the drama was hardly over Republican Joe Pitts an anti abortion Catholic who co authored Stupak s original amendment demanded a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail In response Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans The motion to commit does not support life Stupak declared It is the Democrats who have stood up Heckling from the Republican side interrupted his statement As Stupak looked around the House chamber Rep Randy Neugebauer a right wing Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement began shouting at him from the backbench Baby killer Other Republicans joined in parroting base insults While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a right wing Kristallnacht If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear break their windows Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far right blog hours after the bill passed Break them NOW Break them and run to break again Within three days windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York Kansas and Arizona had been shattered Meanwhile at least Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats Images of nooses were faxed to the offices of Stupak and Clyburn an African American congressman from South Carolina Anthony Weiner an especially vocal proponent of health care reform received a menacing letter filled with white powder The brother of Torn Perriello another health care supporter had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged after a local Tea Party organizer posted his address online he had meant to post the congressman s and encouraged activists to drop by to express their anger about Perriello s recent vote In Tucson Arizona the windows of Democratic Gabrielle Giffbrds office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun And a brick was thrown through the window of Louise s office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper attacks After the Passage of the health care bill the Tea Party floated a gray zone between authoritarianism and anarchy Crusading to restore a holy social order they promoted disorder Claiming to protect democracy they smashed windows of elected representatives Warning of death panels they called in death threats With the atmosphere of violence thickening Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle cry Don t Retreat Instead RELOAD Thus concluded the first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship Max is the author of Republican GOmorrah

3994,Re: Schedule,Will likely start at
3995,Middle East,Congratulations on the resumption of direct talks As evidenced by your activity over the past several weeks your involvement in the peace process inevitably has deepened as the need for high level U S intervention has grown I believe that is a positive result But the more fundamental issue remains what your role can and should be going forward in order to maximize chances of diplomatic success I State of Play As the U S embarks on the next stage in the Israeli Palestinian process it faces a series of tactical and strategic challenges regarding policy politics and personality At a policy level the meager results of indirect talks and difficulties in transitioning to direct talks have underscored the lack of trust between the two sides as well as existing substantive gaps With direct talks begin in the coming days one obstacles will have been removed but several remain Some or all of these may have been resolved in connection with gaining agreement to direct talks a How to handle the renewal or non renewal of Israel s settlement moratorium b What is the goal of the direct talks and is there a consensus on this matter between the parties A comprehensive agreement on permanent CAPS that covers all the details A framework agreement on permanent status FAPS that outlines the governing parameters along the lines of the Clinton parameters Or less ambitiously a short one or two page statement of principles c What role will the U S play Will or another U S official be present in all meetings Will Netanyahu accept that Is there an argument for allowing the two sides to deal with one another without any intermediary at least for a while so that they do not seek to play to the U S d What will the U S do in the event of an impasse or breakdown Should it present bridging proposals and if so when e How much work should be done in parallel and simultaneously with the direct talks between the U S and the Palestinians on the one hand and the U S and Israel on the other Beyond those questions I am persuaded the most important factor is and is likely to remain what Netanyahu is prepared to do You have witnessed first hand how difficult it can be to deal with the Palestinians and the Arab world more generally how fragile is Abbas s political position how indecisive they can be Still at bottom we have a relatively clear sense of their positions on the core issues should we ever reach a moment of truth That is not the case with Netanyahu who either does not know himself or is not prepared to share and who until now has neither felt the urgency to reach a deal nor the discomfort of the status quo Assuming Bibi can be convinced of the benefits of a deal along lines acceptable to the Palestinians this will not occur solely on the basis of his talks with Abbas whom he likes but does not truly respect and who he fears will not be in a position to deliver Rather it will happen only if he feels that it is under the leadership of a U S administration he genuinely trusts he is convinced that the combination of the agreement and U S assurances meets his core needs in terms of Israeli security and international recognition of its Jewish character and he feels that again with U S help he can sell it to his people and survive or even thrive politically Getting Bibi to accept the core compromises will not be enough of course Other basic elements of the strategy must involve reaching out effectively to the Israeli public and ensuring strong vocal Arab support for a U S sponsored deal without which Abbas cannot say yes and Israelis will lack the incentive to do so But the point is that a prerequisite for a successful peace effort is for the U S to convince the prime minister through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure to make the necessary compromises At the end of the day if Bibi is to make a deal it will be a deal with the U S as much as with the Palestinians At a political level the past year has clearly demonstrated the degree to which the U S has been hamstrung by its low ratings in Israel and among important segments of the domestic Jewish constituency This is a critical dimension not for electoral reasons but because the U S s best chance of influencing Bibi is to build support for a deal in Israel and at home among those who care most That capacity has been improved to some extent as a result of the successful visit by Netanyahu and the string of military security deals between our two countries But we must be honest there sill is a long way to go If anything the recent Obama Bibi illustrated a new potentially perverse dynamic the U S president at this juncture needs the Israeli prime minister to validate his pro Israeli credentials more than the Israeli prime minister needs the U S president to vouch for his pro peace ones At the level of personalities with all his skill and perseverance cannot by himself secure serious concessions from the parties by himself In recent discussions both Israelis and Palestinians described him as someone they respected but to whom they would not make major concessions This is the curse of the day to day negotiator When they are ready to deal they will only deal with the players they perceive with authority It was not different for Dennis during the Clinton Administration This does not mean that does not have a crucial role going forward Indeed he can be empowered by your more active involvement The president faces a different but no less difficult problem He is not trusted in Israel and though the meeting might have altered the situation somewhat not trusted by Bibi Domestically he faces a reservoir of skepticism on this issue which reflects many factors including inexcusable prejudice but which could obstruct his effectiveness both as an interlocutor and as a salesman Besides as we learned during WJC s presidency it would be a mistake for Obama to get too deeply invested in negotiations prior to the end point he does not have the time and should not expend the political capital prematurely To do so moreover would automatically be to devalue the role of anyone beneath him thus making the peace process as a whole excessively dependent on his involvement Your Role Under these circumstances in my view your deeper involvement is both essential and potentially highly beneficial It should be a selective involvement still must be the day to day negotiator and others also must play a part In particular I would not recommend you get overly mired in the details of the direct talks or the set of questions I described above about their format goal U S role etc other than at critical junctures Nor would I advise you to get pulled a style shuttle diplomacy which would quickly depreciate your value Rather by injecting yourself strategically at the right time and in the right way you could fill the gaps identified above This is because you are uniquely placed to address the need both for a higher level mediator and for someone who enjoys considerable credibility in Israel and the U S Bibi reportedly told someone recently he was prepared to deal substantively with Obama and with you Your role would be twofold To serve as the higher level interlocutor on matters offinal status To a large degree Abbas s positions are already known they will have to be further explored and he will have to be pushed and you should engage him But we probably know his zone of possible agreement Not so with Bibi and I believe you are ideally suited to begin a series of in depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns how they can be met what he would need from us and others and how far at the end of the day he is prepared to go with the Palestinians if his security and other needs are met Bibi knows and trusts you in fact you are almost certainly the high level U S official he trusts most If you succeed in taking him your confidence and work with him over time you could pave the way for an Israeli U S understanding that would underpin an Israeli Palestinian agreement At times this will require being tough and pushing back against some of his most extreme demands the militarily questionable request for a very long term Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley being one of them and proposing more rational alternatives But the point is that without getting Bibi to trust and level with us without him feeling both what he has to lose but also what he has to gain this process is unlikely to go anywhere To repeat this should not be at s expense It should be a parallel reinforcing process in which you would deal one on one with Abbas and Netanyahu at periodic intervals for extensive periods of time To help restore the US s image and credibility in Israel and among important domestic constituencies You have the history background and credentials to do so here and in Israel and thus to overcome some of the suspicion with which Obama must contend Over time through a series of visits and public statements you would seek to make the case for a peace agreement in positive terms focusing on what benefits it would bring to Israelis rather than on the costs they would incur secure and recognized borders stronger security ties to the U S and others an end to the conflict normal relations with the Arab world and strengthened international legitimacy III Potential Downsides and Responses Dragging you the weeds of negotiations A risk exists that though repeated meetings with Bibi and Abbas you will be drawn detailed discussions over the nature of the territorial compromise the precise security arrangements etc This would be unhelpful both to the process and to you There is a fine line between discussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details of that outcome but it will be important not to cross it Your role should be to extract from Bibi important understandings and parameters e g security arrangements on the Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and minimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence and then have your respective negotiators work out the details Disempowering A related danger is to render powerless by creating the sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you Besides potentially leading him to step down this outcome would not serve your interests for the reasons just cited your effectiveness being a function of your remaining somewhat removed from the day to day specifics of the talks In fact as I see it this process could and should end up strengthening s presently hand by clarifying it Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles the two of you will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that reflect them In that sense both and his counterpart will have a stronger and clearer mandate than currently is the case Involving you in a failed enterprise Of all the potential downsides this is the most significant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly Failure is a real possibility Palestinians are in disarray The Arab world is profoundly divided with forthcoming successions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon which we most rely And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi s politics his head and his heart As a result a powerful argument could be made that you would be better off keeping at arms length from this process especially given how much else is on your plate That said I disagree for the following reasons a By not getting involved you risk the worst of two worlds being associated with a failure which by virtue of your position you inevitably would be and being criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it b Over the past year and a half you have been involved traveling to the region seeking to convince Abbas to enter talks commenting on the settlement freeze in Jerusalem and you will not be able to escape that kind of involvement in the future The problem is that your engagement has appeared to be sporadic rather than strategic that you ve been deployed when it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than in order to implement a long term well thought out plan I do not think that has served you well c While one cannot by any means be confident of success I believe an agreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectively to bring Bibi a position where he believes that the costs of a historical compromise are outweighed by its benefits d If we don t try all we can over the next year or year and a half you will in all likelihood be forced to deal extensively with the Middle East albeit not in a peacemaking but in a crisis managing mode Without movement on the peace process Abbas could depart Fayyad s state building plan could be gone in smoke hostilities might break out between Israel Syria and Hizbollah and the U S would have to deal with Iran in an even less hospitable regional climate

4046,"fyi, it's the economy, any gesture to reverse this... Sid",http www ft com cms s a b df af feabdc dwp uuid ce fa da adae e c print yes html Financial Times FT com r OLUMNISTS JVlartin Wolf Obama was too cautious in fearful times By Martin Wolf Published Au ust j Last updated Suppose that the US presidential election of had in fact taken place in at an early stage in the Great Depression Suppose too that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then though not by the landslide of How different subsequent events might have been The president might have watched helplessly as output and employment collapsed The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened On such chances the wheel of history turns But this time was different the crisis brought Barack Obama to power close to the beginning of the economic collapse I among others then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive Alas it was not I noted on at the beginning of the new presidency Instead of an overwhelming fiscal stimulus what is emerging is too small too wasteful and too ill focused A week later I asked Has Barack Obama s presidency already failed In normal times this would be a ludicrous question But these are not normal times They are times of great danger Today the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance tomorrow it will own it Today it can offer solutions tomorrow it will have become the problem Today it is in control of events tomorrow events will take control of it Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much This was right The direction of policy was not wrong policymakers though not all economists had learnt a great deal from the s Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed together with reconstruction of the financial sector But as Larry Summers Mr Obama s chief economic adviser had said When markets overshoot policymakers must overshoot too Unfortunately the administration failed to follow his excellent advice This has allowed opponents to claim that policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate In consequence the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion have disappeared With the Federal Reserve cautious too the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavy joblessness is high So too are the chances of domestic and global political friction True the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this one were far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US A recent paper by Alan Blinder former vice chairman of the Fed and Mark Zandi of Moody s argues that such critics are wrong They use a standard macro economic model to assess what would have happened without any intervention without the financial interventions including monetary policy and without the fiscal action They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have been close to per cent with no policy response compared to an actual decline of just per cent see chart Similarly the unemployment rate would have peaked at per cent instead of the actual per cent The bigger collapse would also have meant a fiscal deficit of bn in fiscal year The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal response but no financial olic res onse It is a little better the other way round The implication that the modest stimulus package of a mere per cent of GDP spread over several years made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office it argues that in US GDP will be between per cent and per cent higher and the unemployment rate between and percentage points lower as a result of the package Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium unless governments intervene disagree I wish there were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people But I find the idea that allowing the collapse of much of the financial system avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscal deficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre A fascinating perspective does come however from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries The recession in US output and so demand has been relatively small but the decline in employment has been exceptionally large as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity see charts This contrast between what would happen to output and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of the stimulus Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis the relatively small decline in output is remarkable Moreover since fiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output not jobs this is a policy success At the same time the enthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary No doubt some of this is due to the collapse in construction But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives for managers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural My answer from European experience is that one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger In the short run the simplest way to prevent that from happening is to expand demand and so output Since there is huge slack in the labour market not the slightest threat of inflation far more a risk of deflation and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary and fiscal stimulus these are the policies that have to be pursued Yet alas the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep and the administration has lost the initiative So what is going to happen I assume that after the midterm elections resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts and ignore the fiscal deficits They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus though it is much the same thing increasing fiscal deficits thereby offsetting private frugality That would put the administration on the spot It would have to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their yacht and mansion led recovery Any recovery is better than none But it could have been much better than this Those who were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price martin wolf ft com More columns at www ft com martinwolf Copyright The Financial

You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs especially Saudi Arabia to this It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital at this ministry The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs to reach consequential positive results The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace not another deceptive pseudo event in an endlessly unproductive so called peace process And if that one step forward in Oslo in was followed by several steps backwards there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened There can be no doubt about the importance of today s topic The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs the world s conscience as well as its tranquility The Israel Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European colonialism In the post colonial era tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became by degrees the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole It stimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad Since the end of the Cold War the interaction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife It is increasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations For better or ill my own country the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this contest American policies more than those of any other external actor have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in the Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world American policies and actions in the Middle East thus affect much more than that region Yet as I will argue the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance It has failed to involve parties who are essential to peace It has acted on Israel s to preempt rather than enlist international and regional support for peace It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress Its concept of a peace process has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace There are alternatives to tomorrow s diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac And as Norway has shown there is a role for powers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land Over thirty years ago at Camp Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt s Anwar Sadat had opened Twenty years ago the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian leaders setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo The capacity of the United States to rally other governments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied but American power remains far greater than that of any other nation Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East For more than four decades Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily and to sustain its economic prosperity It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of international law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions Unquestioning American support has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the Palestinians or other Arabs Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have brought successive Israeli governments to question let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace Ironically Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America This has locked them a political framework over which Israel exercises decisive influence They have been powerless to end occupation pogroms ethnic cleansing and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers Nor have they been able to prevent their progressive confinement in checkpoint encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open air prison of Gaza Despite this appalling record of failure the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine remains unchallenged Since the end of the Cold War Russia once a contender for countervailing influence in the region has lapsed impotence The former colonial powers of the European Union having earlier laid the basis for conflict in the region have largely sat on their hands while ringing them content to let America take the lead China India and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance In the region itself Iran has postured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it Until recently Turkey remained aloof On rare occasions as in the case of the Arab oil embargo the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israel with action Egypt and Jordan have settled an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U S subventions Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to conclude arrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians But overall Arab governments have earned the contempt of the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement For the most part Arab leaders have timorously demanded that America solve the Israel Palestine problem for them while obsequiously courting American protection against Israel each other Iran and in some cases their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects and citizens Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice It demands that they embody righteousness The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites failure to meet these standards generates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governments associated with it The perpetrators of the terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for American complicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs They justified it as a strike against Washington s protection of Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering Washington s response to the attack included suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies The armed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan Yemen Somalia and other countries Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America They are echoed by Zionist and neo conservative spokesmen in the United States The widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti American passions and catalyzed a metastasis of terrorism It has caused a growing majority of the world s billion Muslims to see the United States as a menace to their faith their way of life their homelands and their personal security American populists and European xenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers terrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers The current outburst of bigoted demagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent illustration of this It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious It rules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat President Obama s inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him He came office committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds His first interview with the international media was with Arab satellite television He reached out publicly and privately to Iran He addressed the Turkish parliament with persuasive empathy He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably eloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injustices in the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious recrafting of strategy in Afghanistan Few doubt Mr Obama s sincerity Yet none of his initiatives has led to policy change anyone can detect let alone believe in It is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration s stewardship of so many aspects of my country s affairs American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two months from tomorrow on the nd of The situation in the Holy Land Iraq Afghanistan and adjacent areas is only part of what they will consider as they do so But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in the situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this Let me begin with the peace process a hardy perennial of America s diplomatic repertoire that the Obama Administration will put back on public display tomorrow In the Cold War the appearance of an earnest and even handed American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U S access and influence in the Middle East It provided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to stand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism It kept American relations with Israel and the Arabs from becoming a zero sum game It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents Of course there hasn t been an American led peace process in the Middle East for at least a decade Still the conceit of a peace process became an essential political convenience for all concerned No one could bear to admit that the peace process had expired It therefore lived on in phantom form Even when there was no peace process the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible cover to the guileful beguilement for the press an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo and last but far from least lifetime employment for career peace processors The perpetual processing of peace without the requirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders It has enabled them to behave like magicians riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their homes settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories and annexed a widening swath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a peace process It s not just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people s suffering Playing peace process charades justifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupied territories It ensures that they have media access and high level visiting rights in Washington Meanwhile for American leaders engagement in some sort of Middle East peace process has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamic worlds as well as with the ever generous American Jewish community Polls show that most American Jews are impatient for peace Despite all the evidence to the contrary they are eager to believe in the willingness of the government of Israel to trade land for it Previous peace processes have exploited all these impulses In practice however these diplomatic distractions have served to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving it Behind all the blather the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped Given this history it has taken a year and a half of relentless effort by U S Envoy to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as they first did here in Oslo seventeen years ago When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washington tomorrow will the players put on a different skit There are many reasons to doubt that they will One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed peace processes to produce and direct this one with no agreed script The last time these guys staged such an ill prepared meeting at Camp in it cost both heads of delegation Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat their political authority It led not to peace but to escalating violence The parties are showing up this time to minimize President Obama s political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States not to address his agenda still less to address each other s agendas These are indeed difficulties But the problems with this latest and possibly final iteration of the perpetually ineffectual peace process are more fundamental The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulates that The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self rule but not as an independent and sovereign state This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine It has no interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion It considers itself unbound by the applicable UN resolutions agreements from past peace talks the Roadmap or the premise of the two state solution The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide But the authority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States not on their standing in the occupied territories Gaza or the Palestinian diaspora Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine Its authority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains power by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States which prefer it to the government empowered by the Palestinian people at the polls Mr Abbas s constitutional term of office has long since expired He presides over a parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails It is not clear for whom he his faction or his administration can now speak So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating with the mandate less The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international credibility The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others the EU Russia and the UN to be able to convene this discussion It will be held under the auspices of an American president who was publicly humiliated by Israel s prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel Palestine dispute Israel s continuing seizure and colonization of Arab land Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air But the peace process has always sneered at deadlines even much much firmer ones A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year was made at Annapolis three years ago Analogous promises of Palestinian self determination have preceded or resulted from previous meetings over the decades beginning with the Camp accords of Many in this audience will recall the five year deadline fixed at Oslo The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if the international community is prepared this time to insist on the one year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian state Even then there will be no peace unless long neglected issues are addressed Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence It is almost impossible to impose It cannot become a reality still less be sustained if those who must accept it are excluded from it This reality directs our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems these absences create Obviously the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them Hamas is not there Yet there can be no peace without its buy in Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers Yet they have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel Both these agreements were explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self determination The Jewish state quickly finessed both Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation A failure to reconcile either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord But the Palestinian diaspora will be represented in Washington only in tenuous theory not in fact Other Arabs including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative Saudi Arabia will not be at the talks tomorrow The reasons for this are both simple and complex At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest installment of the peace process is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation At another level they result from the way the United States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definition evidences Then too they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis Arabs and Americans To begin with neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new peace process have officially acknowledged or responded to the Arab peace initiative of This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state should Israel make peace with the Palestinians Instead the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians and gone on to levy new demands In this connection making Arab recognition of Israel s right to exist the central purpose of the peace process offends Arabs on many levels In framing the issue this way Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East To the Arabs Americans now seem to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel the means by which that state was established and the manner in which it has comported itself Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and accept peace Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti Semitism justified the establishment of a homeland for traumatized European Jews But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of Palestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off putting So is asking them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful Similarly the Arabs see the demand that they recognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel s unilateral expansion at Palestinian expense The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns about Israel as a form of anti Semitism and tuning them out Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views U S peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel They argue that gestures of acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out it has been met with incredulity To most in the region it encapsulates the contrast between Washington s sympathy and solicitude for Israelis and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement of Israel Still others suspect an attempt to construct a peace process in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of carrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis a vis Israel is ludicrously unpersuasive It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work Yet it was a central element of s mandate for peace process diplomacy And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposed follow up to tomorrow s meeting between the parties in Washington It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other Arabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering As a last thought before turning to what must be done let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor Arabic has two quite different words that are both translated as negotiation making a distinction that doesn t exist in either English or Hebrew One word musaawama refers to the no holds barred bargaining process that takes place in bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each other Another mufaawadhat describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship Egyptian President Anwar Sadat s travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of mufaawadhat relationship building between leaders and their polities So was the Arab peace initiative of It called for a response in kind The West muttered approvingly but did not act After a while Israel responded with intermittent somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms But an offer to bicker over the terms on which a grand gesture has been granted is not surprisingly seen as insultingly unresponsive I cite this not to suggest that non Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought but to make a point about diplomatic effectiveness To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction one must understand how that partner understands things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want One of the reasons we can t seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don t make much effort to understand how others reason and how they rank their interests In the case of the Israel Palestine conundrum we Americans are long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very very short on these for the various Arab parties The essential militarism of U S policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties We have become skilled at killing Arabs We have forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them I am not myself an Arabist but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the American diplomatic service These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and empathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw as in our interest If we still have such people we are hiding them well we are certainly not applying their skills in our Middle East diplomacy This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for what must be done In foreign affairs interests are the measure of all things My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians indeed Europeans in general share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land To my mind these interests include but are of course not limited to gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel eliminating the gross injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters as well as friendly Arab regimes and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice including very likely a revival of anti Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to the Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians Arab states like Saudi Arabia also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self determination for Palestinians They may not be concerned to preserve Israel s democracy as we are but they share an urgent interest in ending the radicalization of their own populations curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism and eliminating the tensions with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace as they very clearly did eight years ago For related reasons Saudi Arabia s King Abdullah has made inter faith dialogue and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy As the custodian of two of Islam s three sacred places of pilgrimage Mecca and Medina Saudi Arabia has long transcended its own notorious religious narrow mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all sects and persuasions This experience joined with Islamic piety reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure freedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city It is an interest that Jews Christians and Muslims share There is in short far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel Palestine dispute than is generally recognized This can be the basis for creative diplomacy The fact that this has not occurred reflects pathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination Tomorrow s meeting may well demonstrate that the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding the United States is still unfit to manage the achievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs If so it is in the American interest as well as everyone else s that others become the path breakers enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve but not expecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead Here I think there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the s The Clinton Administration was happy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them It did little to protect them from subversion and overthrow and nothing to insist on their implementation Only a peace process that is protected from Israel s ability to manipulate American politics can succeed This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most Americans establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel securing freedom for the Palestinians and ending the stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails I have only four suggestions to present today I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period A serious effort to cooperate with the Arabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint or parallel action on of peace Now to my suggestions presented in ascending order of difficulty from the least to the most controversial First get behind the Arab peace initiative Saudi Arab culture frowns on self promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted than most at public diplomacy Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press The Israeli media have published some mostly dismissive commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its contents and unfamiliar with its text Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab League declaration and consider the opportunities it presents I suspect the Saudis as well as other members of the Arab League would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation with them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence The Turks and other non Arab Muslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts This wouldn t be bad for Europe s relations with both By the way given the U S media s notorious one sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan a well targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either Second help create a Palestinian partner for peace There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who are empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so as to consolidate its conquest of their homeland Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace partner for Israel by bringing Fatah Hamas and other factions together On each occasion Israel with U S support has acted to preclude this Active organization of non American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference The Obama Administration would be under strong domestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European Arab effort to accomplish this Under some circumstances however it might welcome being put to this test Third reaffirm and enforce international law The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of law internationally In the case of the Middle East however the Council s position at the apex of the international system has served to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule bound international order Almost forty American vetoes have prevented the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions the Nuremberg precedents human rights conventions and relevant Security Council directives American diplomacy on of the Jewish state has silenced the collective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied territory administered collective punishment to a captive people assassinated their political leaders massacred civilians barred UN investigators defied mandatory Security Council resolutions and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior usually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses If ethnic cleansing settlement activity and the like are not just unhelpful but illegal the international community should find a way to say so even if the UN Security Council cannot Otherwise the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization its vision of the rule of law will be lost When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles all exempt themselves and the law of the jungle prevails The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel both as occupier and as regional military hegemon is legally accountable internationally for its actions If the UN General Assembly cannot unite for peace to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot member states should not shrink from working in conference outside the UN framework All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyond need to understand that they are not above the law If this message is firmly delivered and enforced there will be a better chance for peace Fourth set a deadline linked to an ultimatum Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UN Security Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians Organize a global conference outside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement in a year one of two solutions will be imposed Schedule a follow up conference for a year later The second conference would consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel s borders or recognition of Israel s achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine requiring Israel to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions boycott and disinvestment Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face the consequences of their recalcitrance Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of the international community Admittedly any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomatic confrontation with the United States as well as Israel despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow s talks Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit immensely from peace with the Palestinians Time is running out The two state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlement activity Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing If so it will not be local or regional but global in its reach Israel s actions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who are determined to destroy it Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to alleviate It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage against injustice that incites terrorism It is time to try new approaches That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation between Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked to set the stage for a discussion of this issue

4085,briefed Ed Luce of FT on this... Sid,Financial Times FT com Politics Foreign policy Clinton s aim is true as Democrats top gun By Edward Luce in Washington Published I Last updated Nobody would go so far as to call it a comeback But Bill Clinton s appearances on the midterm election trail are starting to turn voters heads in a way that Barack Obama s simply are not Democratic operatives say that Mr Clinton who went through in the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr Obama will face in less than three weeks is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly different alternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the Obama administration So far the president who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning has been unable to pull that off This week alone Mr Clinton has shaken up two Senate races in Kentucky and West Virginia with appearances that have assisted Democratic candidates Mr Clinton was due to speak in Las Vegas on night to assist the embattled Harry Reid the Senate majority leader and then move onto California later in the week Bill Clinton is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got says Norm Ornstein a political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute He has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobody else can do right now Mr Clinton s intervention in Kentucky where Jack Conway the Democratic candidate is locked in a tight race with Rand the Tea Party icon is a good case in point At the weekend Mr Clinton described Mr who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government and has talked of abolishing the Federal Reserve as a radical with no record to back it up Mr who has never run for elected office hit back by reminding voters of Mr Clinton s former Lewinsky scandal I am not sure I would trust a man who had sex with an intern said Mr I mean do you think he s an honourable person Mr s trip down memory lane appears to have backfired Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal that occurred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets job creation and the absence of foreign wars Bill Clinton s strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity advantage says Tad Devine a veteran Democratic operative He is also able to enter an individual race take the temperature understand what people are feeling and then base his appeal to voters on that In the West Virginia Senate race where Joe Manchin the governor is trailing Raese a wealthy local businessman Mr Clinton on came out punching Referring to Mr Raese s plush Florida vacation home the former president said I m here for a lot of reasons One is that I don t think it s fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida to have three Acknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr Obama has per cent rating among the lowest in the country Mr Clinton added I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad and I am not just talking about politics here there is about an per cent chance you will make a mistake In contrast a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr Obama has framed the midterm campaign shifting from one attack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative Last month Mr Obama turned on Boehner the Republican congressional leader in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters alternative More recently Mr Obama has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money attack ads But it has generated a lot of criticism This election is awash with undisclosed money and it s fair to point out how disadvantaged the Democrats have been says one consultant But it isn t good politics at this late stage when voters clearly want to hear about the economy Copyright The Financial Times Limited Print a single copy of this article for personal use Contact us if you wish to print more to distribute to others FT and Financial Times are trademarks of the Financial Times Privacy policy I Terms Copyright The Financial Times Ltd

4122,Max from Amsterdam on rise of far right in Europe,http maxblumenthal com the return of ghosts debating the rise of geert wilders and the far right The Return of Ghosts Debating the rise of Geert Wilders and the far right at the Nexus Symposium On By Max The Nexus Institute s Return of Ghosts conference was inspired by the rise of far right politician Geert Wilders in the Netherlands I spent last week in Amsterdam where I participated in the Return of Ghosts symposium of the Nexus Institute a discussion debate about the resurgence of neo fascism in Europe and anti democratic trends in the West Besides providing a forum for debating European politics the symposium was the occasion for the first public appearance in Europe by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature last month The arrival of Vargas Llosa one of the world s foremost intellectuals resulted in an overflow crowd filled with members of the Dutch media the country s political class and the royal family Even with Vargas Llosa in the spotlight the participants attention was focused on Geert Wilders the leader of the far right Dutch People s Party for Freedom and Democracy which is now the third leading party in the Netherlands With his gathering influence Wilders has essentially placed the Dutch coalition government in a stranglehold the government meets with him every to gauge his opinions and ask for his instructions While Wilders dictates at will to the government he remains independent of it comfortably avoiding the consequences of policies he has helped to shape It is the perfect position for a politician whose agenda is comprised exclusively of xenophobic populism and typical strategy of the far right in countries across the continent Wilders base lies in the mostly Catholic south where ironically few people have ever encountered a Muslim He has also generated support in the city of Groeningen once a citadel of the communists Seeking to expand his base Wilders promised to hire scores of animal cops to investigate and prosecute the abuse of animals a clever wedge strategy in the only country I know of that has a party dedicated exclusively to animal rights Of course Wilders could care less about our furry friends His stated goal is to end immigration not just to Holland but to all of Europe ban the Quran free speech is only for the Judeo Christian community and severely limit the rights of Muslim citizens of Europe by for instance instituting what he called a head rag tax on Muslim women Wilders international allies include the goosestepping neo Nazis of the English Defense League the far right pogromist Pam Geller the Belgian neo fascist party Vlaams Belang and a substantial portion of the US neocon elite Over the course of just a few years he has become perhaps the most influential Islamophobe in the world But does this make Wilders a fascist Rob Riemen the director of the Nexus Institute thinks so Riemen has just published a book entitled De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme or The Eternal Return of Fascism I eagerly await its English translation dedicated to highlighting the danger of Wilders eerily familiar brand of right wing populism In the book Riemen urges readers to compare Wilders politics to the early incarnations of European fascism not to the genocidal terminal stage fascism of late World War II He calls the parallels between Wilders and the early fascists one and one In an economic and civilizational crisis like the kind the Netherlands is facing Riemen warns that reactionary figures like Wilders can easily seize power while centrist elements stand by politely and passively refusing to call a spade a spade Where Wilders ascendancy will lead is unknown but if he is not stopped in his tracks Riemen is certain the B story will not end well In the week after its publication Riemen s book flew off the shelves selling copies while generating heated reactions from across the spectrum of debate Riemen told me that despite the public enthusiasm for his book his characterization of Wilders has been attacked as un Dutch In Dutch culture as in so many others open confrontation is avoided at all cost Political disagreement is welcomed only if it is expressed in a collegial manner as though nothing more than reputations were at stake So the Dutch cultural elite generally goes along to get along The resistance Riemen has met since he called Wilders out seemed to have alarmed and frustrated him Why was it so difficult for liberal elements in the Netherlands to recognize the clear resonances of fascism in Wilders political style he wondered And why did they seem more concerned with regulating the terms of debate than with forming a united front against the far right Once the symposium opened and I was able to see the Dutch elite in action I began to understand Riemen s indignation The symposium began with a speech by Vargas Llosa a complex personality who has allied himself with center right parties in Spain and elsewhere but whose politics remain fundamentally rooted in cultural liberalism Vargas Llosa s differences with leaders of the left which he used to belong to exploded over the issue of free trade He is an ardent neo liberal and reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez and anta Humala who advocate protectionism and industrial nationalization Vargas Llosa decorated his speech with literary metaphors and natural imagery to describe the challenges of democracy particularly in Europe But the body of the address was devoted to the supposed threat Islamic extremism posed to Western civilization Vargas Llosa singled out suicide bombing as the most dangerous phenomenon pointing to the Madrid and London bombings by al Qaida inspired operatives while curiously not mentioning suicide attacks by secular groups like the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK or the nationalistic suicide terror by Palestinian militants Vargas Llosa declared in his speech that Israel deserves to be treated like any other nation and has been harshly critical of the state in the past During the first panel which I participated in Fania Oz Salzberger an Israeli professor of history and the daughter of famed author Amos Oz boasted to crowd of Israel s vibrant democracy She was enthusiastically seconded by Cohen a former editor of Dissent who has devoted considerable energy to assailing anti Zionist Jews writing that the dominant species of anti Semitism encourages anti Zionism I found it odd that neither expressed any concern over the almost endless stream of anti democratic laws passing through the Knesset or by the general authoritarian anti liberal trend in Israeli society Oz Salzberger went on to announce to a smattering of applause that Geert Wilders and politicians like him are not welcomed by Israelis Yet Wilders is one of Israel s most frequent guests having visited the country over times in years In fact he claims that his views on Islam and Arabs were forged while living on an Israeli moshav Nowhere did I have the special feeling of solidarity that I get when I land at Ben Gurion airport he once said Wilders reportedly receives heavy support from Dutch financial backers of Israel and has met with a range of Israeli officials His closest allies lie within the extremist settler movement prompting him to call for the forced transfer of Palestinians to Jordan Members of the liberal Zionist intelligensia like Oz Salzberger may not not want Wilders around but who in Israel is listening to them Israel s mainstream leadership echoes Wilders crudest talking points on a regular basis while the Zionist left clings to a dwindling handful of Knesset seats and watches passively even resentfully as a rag tag band of leftist radicals fights for equality for all Consider a recent statement by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert who is seen as a centrist within the Israeli political spectrum The origin of terrorism is within Islam Olmert declared this month The pro Israel position of the new breed of European far rightists has to be recognized as much more than a convenient political tactic Of course saying you stand with Israel as Wilders so often does is an easy way to insulate yourself from charges of anti Semitism But the extreme right is also attracted to Israel because the country represents its highest ideals While some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state people like Wilders see Israel as a racist apartheid state and they like it They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells the world to go to hell they admire Israel s settler culture and most of all they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges its ethnic majority above all others to the point that it systematically humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass The endgame of the far right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli After the Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D Arcais proclaimed that Italy was no longer a democratic country citing PM Silvio Berlusconi s control over percent of the country s media the government s deep seated corruption and the Prime Minister s repeated attempts to impose onerous restrictions on journalistic freedom Riemen asked me if the United States was a democracy given the the rapidly rising influence of corporations over the media and elections After two panelists had described Israel as a vibrant democracy while another labeled Italy a non democratic quasi dictatorship I decided that our definition of democracy was subjective at best So I sidestepped the question and outlined a few of the greatest blows to American democracy from the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine to the Telecommunications Deregulation Act to the Citizens United SCOTUS decision Later in the evening D Arcais would remark to me with amazement that he never knew American media was ever regulated in the first place During the minutes or so when students of Tilburg University were able to question the panel one student asked whether suicide terror was a uniquely Islamic phenomenon apparently referring to Vargas Llosa s address I responded that it of course was not citing the example of secular groups like the Tamil Tigers which brought the tactic practice the second suicide I recommended the audience review the research of Pape the University of Chicago political scientist who demonstrated a clear connection between the American and Israeli occupation of Middle Eastern countries and the motivations of suicide bombers Oz Salzberger jumped in proclaiming that occupation has little or nothing to do with the motives of suicide bombers She did not marshal any evidence to support her point possibly because our time was so limited It would have been hard to do so however without supporting the fundamental argument of Wilders about Islam s inherent violence or the even sillier theory by the Israeli filmmaker professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov that suicide bombers are motivated by sexual repression Next the Dutch panel took the stage The main attraction was Frits Bolkstein the longtime leader of the People s Party for Freedom and Democracy who employed Wilders as his parliamentary aide providing him a stepping stone to his political career He was a silver haired curmudgeon from aristocratic stock who reminded me instantly of the paleocon characters I ve met while covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance Everything went wrong when the government became impressed in the s with the idea of the good stranger Bolkstein declared If the previous governments had tightened their immigration laws there would not have been a Mr Wilders The only member of the panel to mount a significant challenge to Bolkstein was the Tilburg University professor Frissen who argued that the rule of law and basic standards of democracy protects the right to be fundamentalist The other panelists either gave Bolkstein s xenophobia a pass or attempted to surpass his resentment of Muslims After Bolkstein lightly criticized Wilders call for banning the Quran remarking that what he says about Islam is nonsense because it contradicts the freedom of religion AB Klink a former Dutch senator and ex Minister of Health chimed in It s not nonsense because Islam is so different in its cultural values than ours Klink claimed Then when Bolkstein called for shutting down Islamic schools Frissen reminded him that state supported Christian schools in the Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts as well Meindert Fennema the political biographer of Wilders entered the debate to demand that all religious schools be closed I m against all forms of religious teaching he proudly exclaimed sending gales of applause through the audience How can you call yourself a liberal Frissen asked with a tone of exasperation Fennema ignored him During question time a young freelance writer from India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein to answer for the ghost of neo colonialism which the African people never voted for She mentioned the exploitative deals forced on developing countries by transnational oil companies possibly alluding to Bolkstein s role as a manager at Royal Dutch Shell in authoritarian countries like El Salvador Indonesia and Honduras during the s I m sure nothing unseemly happened during Bo stein s tenure in these places Bolkstein s responded bluntly If these countries try to be self sufficient it just doesn t work After the symposium I talked to Ginwala and a group of her friends who were mostly immigrant students They were appalled by the ignorance of the Dutch panelists None of them knew the first thing about Islam an Arab student remarked They couldn t even pretend to understand what Muslims actually believe Ginwala added How can Bolkstein tell me my country can t be self sufficient I come from India It s one of the most diversified economies on the planet I was not in Amsterdam long enough to do any formal reporting However I did notice that all of the immigrants I spoke to were closely and nervously following the rise of the right At the airport while waiting to board my flight I talked to a something security guard named Muhammad who seemed almost as bored as I was Muhammad had spent his whole life in Amsterdam but his parents were from Cairo Egypt He told me he wanted to take his girlfriend on a trip to New York City and Miami someday When I brought up the topic of Wilders he scoffed at his perception of Muslims Most of us aren t even religious Muhammad said When I hear him talking about Muslims wanting to take over I just laugh I m like is this guy serious But he did not underestimate Wilders appeal Everything he does and everything he says it seems like it s carefully planned He obviously knows what he s doing And they let him get away with it Muhammad remarked Look I m just a citizen I m nobody but if I say something about Christians or Jews that the government doesn t like I ll be punished But when Wilders who is a public official says all the things he says about Muslims nothing happens to him Instead more and more people are voting for him

4135,"Re: In case you missed, and see last graph. Sid",Maybe And of course worth the effort Without an effort the two state solution is dead if failed on the other hand also dead Another idea don t know if it can be made to work How to introduce Israel entering the NPT and ending its nuclear ambiguity which is its state policy but which itself is the model for Iran now Can this issue be used profitably in negotiations a wild card as it were Can options be developed on whether it can how it might work potential effect on peace process Israel s nuclear ambiguity policy is certainly a big issue coming given Iran See below from Haaretz today Home Print Edition Nt ws Published Latest update Interview Why Israel should end its policy of nuclear ambiguity An interview with Avner Cohen expert on nonproliferation issues and author of the forthcoming book The Worst Kept Secret Israel s Bargain with the Bomb By Nia tasha Mozwvava Tags Israel news Avner Cohen is a senior fellow of the Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies He is the author of Israel and the Bomb and the forthcoming The Worst Kept Secret Israel s Bargain with the Bomb Avner Cohen you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity Why now and why would that be good for Israel Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking It was born many years ago and sealed as part of a comprehensive deal with the United States in It was appropriate at the time but today in my opinion it is not just anachronistic but foolish and anti democratic Even in realpolitik terms it is an own goal for Israel In my view it undermines genuine Israeli interests including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the responsible states in this strategic field Are you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program its usually marginal The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small just state surrounded by enemies and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh Israel s image was different then In the long term the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two state solution the more it will be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the nuclear issue The situation of ambiguity in which you don t have real legitimacy is not a good place to be The United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty but during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s visit to Washington U S President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the threats Israel faces and these threats warrant special security measures The Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred They want to look as though they respect that This agreement with the U S has been passed along from president to president but I don t believe this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis Do you give credence to the slippery slope theory under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands that Israel disarm Those are cliches used by the defense establishment Nobody demands that Israel make such an announcement without first doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous Israel has its own interests nobody can coerce it to do things What about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race against Israel I don t dismiss that claim out of hand and if after study and thought this fear turns out to be warranted I would be prepared to wait But in some ways ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs The claim you mention treats Arabs as though they were children If they are told that Israel doesn t admit to it that frees them of the need to deal with the reality I believe the Arab countries don t want to play a game of make believe but rather want to discuss the topic directly and realistically You say basically that Iran is imitating Israel s nuclear behavior That comparison would certainly rankle Israel supporters But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests but rather by rumors It can even remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty If that rankles anybody let it rankle If Iran is not attacked it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity I see this as nearly certain The international community thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate The norm that a state with a nuclear weapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime The longer Iran continues down this path the less patience the world will have for Israel How do you envision the scenario of coming out of the nuclear closet Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity So long as there is a military censor it is very hard to alter ambiguity If censorship didn t exist israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more openly Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic There is a Shin Bet security service law but there is no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission This is a very problematic situation On the international level it s a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work Ultimately I see a political statement by Israel s government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table He would talk about the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic With a few rare exceptions these weapons have no military use Israel views them as a means of deterrence I don t think Israel would need to go detail regarding how many bombs it has or exactly what it has Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi or even the United States Ambiguity creates a sense that we are sinners as though we had done something so terrible that we can t tell the awful truth and I don t think it is so awful This is a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time and the time has come for it to say something positive on this huge complicated and awe inspiring topic All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons Whether that will happen in our lifetimes I can t say You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death such as the question of whose finger will be on the button Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion There has been very little creative thinking in this area and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an unacceptable closed culture incapable of creative thinking Ambiguity s power derives from the fact that Israeli society accepts it and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be handled by trustworthy hands so that it does not have to take responsibility itself Ambiguity has created an ignorant craven public which in a certain sense has betrayed its civic democratic duties on this subject What s it like researching a topic nobody discusses When I started studying this subject years ago I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could be touched It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly from a researcher s perspective not from the standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter Today I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete real issues Print Page Send to a friend Comments Share Text Size Follow us on Twitter Become a Haaretz com Faceboolr friend This story is by atasha Mozoovaya

Sid",Subject H fyi to discuss when you come up for air Sid http www newsweek com europe s new politics of fear print html Europe s New Politics of Fear by MacShaneApril There is a new divide in Europe Not an iron curtain but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for their nations woes In Western Europe it is Muslims In Eastern Europe they are Jews Roma and gays In the Netherlands Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in on the back of anti Muslim anti Quran populism In Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on Jewish capital which wants to devour the entire world To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti Jewish Jobbik Party which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists Its leaders want to wear the neo Nazi uniform of the pre Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest s Parliament Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti Semitism They prefer the term radical populism but to anyone with half a sense of European history the parallels with an older Jew baiting politics can no longer be dismissed Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the first half of the last century Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is producing the same toxic politics The Fidesz leader Viktor Orban was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after Now he strikes a much more nationalist tone His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package Unlike Greece which is being helped so far by its euro zone partners Hungary was alone as boom time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be paid back in an ever devaluing forint Blaming the Socialist government globalization and international capital was easy But Fidesz went further In a bid for votes on the far right a Fidesz parliamentarian Oszkar Molnar says it s time to give primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital Jewish capital Like Jean Marie Le Pen s National Front in France Jobbik has the support of about percent of Hungarian voters The Czech right wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader former premier Mirek Topolanek after he attacked the Jewish origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister In a new book The Populist Radical Right in Poland the Oxford educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes Antisemitism is crucial to the Polish populist right The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal but the anti Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a general hostility to diversity and to Polish liberal democracy For the time being criticism of nationalist politics is suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air crash tragedy this month But the record of his party activists including Michal Kaminski Poland s best known M E P and leader of a small right wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament is disturbing An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet Kaminski uses ugly language about gays and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II when Jews apologize for killing Poles Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing But Fidesz is affiliated with the center right European People s Party which groups Angela Merkel s ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany Nicolas Sarkozy s Union for a Popular Movement government in France and ruling conservative parties in Sweden Italy and Belgium When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago the European Union held Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking Jewish capital in language even Haider didn t dare utter So radical populism anti Muslim in Western Europe anti Jewish in Eastern Europe and anti foreigner and anti immigrant rhetoric everywhere is no longer fringe politics In Britain s general election all the main parties are seeking to appease anti foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living and working abroad Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn Fascism is dead and not coming back But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe and no one knows how to deal with it http www newsweek com how marine le pen is changing french politics print html B Eit What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe Marine Le Pen is moving her father s rabble rousing far right party away from the fringe and redefining French politics in the process by Tracy McNicoll and DickeySeptember amuel Bollendorff The New York Times Redux Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front the right wing party her father Jean Marie left leads today Jean Marie Le Pen the year old firebrand of France s far right the man who for decades has played on the inchoate fears xenophobia knee jerk racism and ill disguised anti Semitism of many of his supporters had just finished speaking to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel As members of the youth wing of his National Front party feasted on barbecue and apple pie they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth still the provocateur taunting the establishment the toreador who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull Even these youngsters knew however that Jean Marie s time in the ring is nearing an end The old man himself made it clear he s determined to step down All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine She has the will the courage the temperament necessary and the competence Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse It seems to me indisputable that she is our camp s best candidate for Tall blonde plain spoken and thick skinned Le Pen s youngest child at is the heir apparent to his party She s expected to win the contest for its leadership in and she s a passionate advocate of its core message strong French nationalism relentless Euro skepticism and a lot of hard nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration She s a fresh face a new look and with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible candidates a new threat in French politics In the eyes of many she s more effective and thus more dangerous than her father It s a measure of the Le Pens enhanced power that they ve managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and cast their own party as mainstream Over the summer Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left which began after his election in He had cherry picked popular Socialists for his centrist government dividing their party But in elections this past Sarkozy s UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of regional governments So he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration He proposed taking citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma or Gypsies booting hundreds out of the country While the measures proved popular in opinion polls Sarkozy ironically did not His abysmal approval ratings remain in the low s The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm I think I get on his nerves quite a bit she says My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father The old man could be painted as a creature of the past a purveyor of old prejudices with a sulfurous reputation says Marine Today however the Front wants to bill itself as neither left nor right If that means losing some fringe elements many of whom support Marine s rival Bruno Gollnisch well tent pis she says Other right wing movements in Europe are also pushing the political mainstream The government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme one of them the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi A falling out between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics In the Netherlands the militantly Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn out process of trying to build a new coalition government Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that s made in the U S A Put aside the usual caricature of people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan Marine Le Pen says and she still believes the American right is much more to the right than the National Front She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration but she s also a big believer in the state s ability and obligation to help its people We feel the state should have the means to intervene she says We are very attached to public services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French including access for all to the same level of health care Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by competing factions on the right as well as by the left When Marine was just someone set off a kilo bomb in the family s Paris apartment building Miraculously no one was killed or seriously injured but the front of the building was brought down The crime has never been solved The worst part wasn t just the attack it was that not a single politician sent a word of condolence she says It was difficult but it builds character it hardens you That s a real asset in political life anywhere If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential race a year and a half from now he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer With Barbie Nadeau in Rome
4156,FW:,FYI The Christian Science Monitor CSMonitor com War on terror Obama softened the language but hardened Muslim hearts The Obama administration s shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and soften Americans fear of Islam But the new rhetoric hasn t matched policy and the unintended costs at home and abroad have been high By Gottlieb posted at am EDT New Haven Conn One of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration s counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change America s rhetorical approach to the threat of terrorism particularly Islamic terrorism The language we use matters President Obama told the Arabic satellite television station Al Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office Scrubbed were W Bush era terms like war on terrorism radical Islam and jihadist The White House s National Security Strategy formally replaced the term Islamic terrorism with violent extremism The purpose of the shift in semantics was two fold First it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda not against Islamic extremism which Mr Obama believes contributed to a post perception that America was at war with Islam Indeed the new rhetoric has gone hand in hand with Obama s outreach to the Muslim world to build a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest Second it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans fear of Islamic terrorism which Obama officials believe plays directly the hands of extremists Language change ineffective Now it is fair to ask whether Obama s use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective Startling new polls suggest it hasn t The first by the Brookings Institution in Washington shows that between and the number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in Obama s approach toward their region dropped from percent to just percent with those describing themselves as discouraged by the Obama presidency rising from percent to percent The second by the Pew Research Center shows that in fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam percent than five years earlier during the Bush administration percent with more Americans percent saying Islam encourages violence more than other religions in it was percent These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism Yes terrorism is a propaganda fueled activity an ongoing battle to win hearts and minds and attract new recruits to fight for the cause And of course the language used in combating terrorism is vital the counterproductive smoke em out rhetoric of the Bush administration is a case in point But if rhetoric does not match policy or appears to discount or play down threats the credibility and thus effectiveness of the overall counterterrorism strategy may be undermined It appears the Obama administration has dug itself just such a hole Rhetoric doesn t match policy When looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises what Muslims around the world see is an administration that has ramped up the war in Afghanistan is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes continues to hold more than Muslim detainees in Guantanamo Bagram and other prisons and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel This is not to critique these policies but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world and have only muddled Obama s oft stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist movements The price of downplaying the threat A large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush s hard line tactics the USA Patriot Act warrantless surveillance indefinite detentions the White House has consistently played down the threat even in the face of a clear uptick in terrorism activity For example following the failed Christmas Day airline bombing Obama described the suspect as an isolated extremist despite his ties to Al Qaeda And the administration s initial response to the failed Times Square bombing by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to call it a one off event Attorney General Holder stated in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic terror plots were unconnected and unrelated to radical Islam There is little doubt that the administration s unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on the public s trust A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue of terrorism percent to percent up from percent to percent last fall Time to reverse the trend Obama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism and in many ways he has His instincts to maintain aggressive tactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric were sound Yet his administration seems to have overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years that overstating the threat of terrorism has costs attached So too does rhetoric that understates the threat especially when detached from policy It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric which has not paid dividends at home or abroad and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced and the policies employed to confront them Gottlieb a former foreign policy adviser and speechwriter in the US Senate is now director of policy studies at

4195,"If bilateral talks fail, a regional approach",For your reading a summary of an interesting proposal by former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher Palestinian Israeli Direct Talks The Case for a Regional Approach By Marwan Muasher Carnegie Endowment Bulletin Marwan Muasher former Jordanian foreign minister ambassador and deputy prime minister advocates a regional settlement to the Israeli Palestinian conflict capitalizing on the Arab Peace Initiative His approach depends first on securing end game deposits from all parties The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might not be willing to give at the onset but that can be deposited with the U S and committed to only if the other side is willing to do the same Saudi Arabia s deposit for instance would outline and agree to a package that included details about Jerusalem The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises the Palestinians would need to accept Muasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track asking Syria to deposit end game commitments in return for full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights In their deposits the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to address the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement The Arab states would not only have to end all logistical financial and military support for these two groups but they would have to assume responsibility for delivering these two actors helping to transform them political players Israel s deposit would spell out its commitment to a solution based on borders and a return of the Golan According to Muasher these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending the conflict After he has been given Arab cover Abbas could provide his own end game deposits According to Muasher absent these commitments from the Arab states the Palestinian positions will remain maximalist Once the U S has deposits from all sides that make for a reasonable comprehensive package it should put this package on the table in cooperation with the Quartet Once the comprehensive package is presented the U S can focus on confidence building measures to move all sides toward the end game AM

4205,H: American Bridge debuts. Sid,Effort for Liberal Balance to G O P Groups Begins By MICHAEL LUO In what may prove a significant development for the elections Brock a prominent Democratic political operative says he has amassed million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to set up what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican leaning outside groups that spent so heavily on this year s midterm elections Kathleen Kennedy Townsend a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of F Kennedy s children has agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group which will be called American Bridge lending to the still extremely nascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay heir to the Taco Bell fortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance a partnership of wealthy liberal donors Dyson who heads Dyson Kissner Moran a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City and Marcia L Carsey a television producer who gave million to Democratic outside groups in Mr Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on to set up American Bridge as what is known as an independent expenditure only political action committee meaning it will be able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors Certain to set off debate however is that Mr Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund raising consultants can raise money for Democratic oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one of the nonprofit organizations Mr Brock currently runs Media Matters Action Network which does not disclose its donors The action network which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations is organized as a c nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the elections including potentially running television ads according to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge s and Media Matter Action Network s plans obtained by The New York Times Mr Brock said that money is money and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and in the end the media spending would be apportioned accordingly The moves by Mr Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists to establish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left s answer in to such groups on the right as the U S Chamber of Commerce American Crossroads and others which significantly outspent Democratic leaning outside groups this year It is too early to say whether Mr Brock s group will emerge as the go to vehicle for giant contributions on the left Mr Brock led a much heralded independent group in the presidential election that failed to gain much traction after the Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups But Mr Brock a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late s is a respected political player who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Matters umbrella Mr Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined million this year Its backers include major Democratic donors like Soros the billionaire who recently announced he had given million to the group Peter B the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance who like Mr Soros gave more than million to Democratic oriented groups in and the Hollywood producer Steve Bing My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollars to these types of efforts Mr Brock said They just need to be asked and I have no doubt they will step up at this critical time There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to be more heavily involved in the elections White House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic leaning outside groups getting involved in the elections a change from the Obama campaign s attitude toward such groups in But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed The lack of disclosure among Republican leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year as spending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections But the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White House and to win back some of what was lost in the House and Senate may trump those principles Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raise money if the option of offering anonymity is available It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on to essentially tie one hand behind your back Mr McKay said Besides Mr Brock numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts On for instance Steve Rosenthal who was the chief executive of America Coming Together a Democratic fund raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the election convened a group of political operatives many of whom were active in that election at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for No one however has apparently gone as far as Mr Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up an organization Mr Brock said the million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank account by the end of the first quarter of By way of comparison America s Families First Action Fund one of the major Democratic independent efforts in House races this year raised just over million for the entire cycle up until mid The internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year including initially focusing on attacking vulnerable Republicans in the Senate and the House as a prelude to major spending in

4337,Gender- Melanne's Comments on QDDR,HRC can you print for HRC is stepping through the QDDR and giving specific edits on each section to ensure the integration of gender In addition to that help she shared her thoughts concerns on the reorganization as it affects s GWI We already determined from your earlier feedback that S GWI would maintain a direct report to S I actually always thought that even with the reorganization of homes for many of the S offices we still were maintaining a direct S reporting so we are revisiting this issue writ large for the next draft to you For example we now know statutorily that S CT legislatively is a required S report That said here is her narrative for your review for when we speak I have embedded comments in caps in text after each graph where relevant TO Anne Marie FROM DATE RE Gender Integration in the QDDR The Secretary has declared time and time again that the empowerment of women is at the heart of the foreign policy of the United States Our collective task is to realize this principle by integrating gender the policies and programs of the State Department and USAID in an enduring way We are concerned that the current draft of the QDDR falls short of this call In the existing draft the Office of Women s Issues falls under a new Under Secretary for Civilian Security Democracy and Human Rights while retaining the Ambassador at Large for Women s Issues who reports directly to the Secretary This new structure misses the simple but important reality that women are half of the world s population and that the major security economic and social challenges of this century cannot be solved without them These issues cut across the work of the department and touch virtually all regions though we place special emphasis on regions in which women and girls are most vulnerable such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition Locating the office within one bureau makes it impossible for the Office to implement its very charge to integrate gender effectively the work of the entire State Department Therefore gender must be integrated throughout all of the regional and functional bureaus rather than located within one bureau Women should be integral to all of our diplomatic efforts from traditional bilateral and multilateral relationships strategic dialogues and public diplomacy to our relations with civil society community leaders and other non state actors Women are also important to consider in all of our policy initiatives including global health food security climate change economic issues human rights and peace and security We must institute rigorous institutional mechanisms to ensure that all bureaus both regional and functional consider gender in diplomacy and development In order to integrate gender effectively throughout the work of the Department we recommend the following approach to planning budgeting structure and evaluation Maintain visibility and focus on gender Retain the Ambassador at Large for Women s Issues who reports to the Secretary This position embodies our commitment to and advocacy for gender equality as an essential part of diplomacy and development and signals our understanding that this is important to the national security of the United States In addition the office advances a coherent and coordinated strategy on gender throughout the State Department and USAID DONE Ensure that gender is effectively addressed throughout all bureaus and missions We recommend the following structural changes at State First make the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary PDAS in all regional and functional bureaus responsible and accountable for their bureaus work on gender The Office of Women s Issues would serve as a resource to the PDAS on these issues Second assign specialized gender liaisons to regional bureaus for purposes of integration where needed Third include training and capacity development for employees on gender Issues in both Foreign and Civil Service as well as for political appointees Fourth evaluate the PDAS in each bureau on gender integration in policies and programs including for example as a component in the Performance Evaluation System Similarly require each Chief of Mission to be responsible and accountable for the mission s work on gender to assign personnel with expertise to manage the work on gender to require personnel to receive training on gender issues and to be evaluated on this work A parallel structure should be put in place at USAID and our diplomacy and development work on gender should be coordinated and complimentary THIS IS RECOMMENDATION WITH SOME VARIATION MADE FOR MANY AREAS PUBLIC DIPLOMACY MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS AND OTHERS CHALLENGE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY HOW TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY AND CREAT A PDAS JOB THAT IS MEANINGFUL GIVEN THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOUGHT TO BE IMPOSED THROUGH THAT POSITION Include gender in strategic planning and budget allocation We recommend continuing the requirement initiated last year that all bureaus include a plan for gender integration in their annual Strategic Plan and Budget proposal Each bureau is required to describe how their policies and programs will improve gender equality and how that will strengthen their work more generally They are also required to the extent possible to outline what portion of their policies and programs target or affect women and girls THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED Measure impact Develop indicators and long term evaluation systems to measure the impact of programs on women and girls There are efforts underway currently within F and at USAID to consider how to improve our measurement of impact on women and girls and to develop different and additional indicators where appropriate SAME AS IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THIS IS ALREADY IN PROCESS Happy to discuss cdm

4339,and so it begins,Post Daley circus gets started early Easier to count those who aren t running than those who are By Rick Pearson Hal Dardick Tribune reporters PM CDT The post Daley era in Chicago politics began with all of the promise of baseball s Opening Day no winners no losers and everyone proclaiming they have a shot at the crown With Mayor Daley saying he would not endorse a successor for the Feb city election various political factions engaged in private meetings and a flurry of phone calls aimed at separating the contenders from the pretenders There will be a lot of candidates Daley said after his first City Council meeting since announcing he would not seek a seventh term Look at the City Council All are candidates right now They all want to be candidates for mayor and why not This the best job in America right here In the anteroom behind the City Council chambers the scene was controlled chaos as more than a dozen aldermen white black and Latino happily stepped out of the meeting to give interviews to anyone who wanted to listen about how they could be the city s next mayor But the prospective candidates following the old political adage that it s better to be looked over than overlooked weren t limited to City Hall In Washington White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was touted by another Chicagoan President Barack Obama s political guru as having the skills and personality to be a big city mayor Amid all the early jockeying bluffing and bullying veteran Aid Mell rd outlined the nuts and bolts reality of mounting a mayoral campaign with only weeks before the Nov deadline for submitting petitions Someone s got to have some serious money This isn t something you just decide Mel said It takes a full scale ward by ward operation to identify your votes and get them out to vote Mell also talked about the qualities to look for in a winning candidate someone who will be a unifier and can t be looked at as looking at one segment of the city Still many politicians were beginning their assessment by gauging the mood of their political base I don t know if it s as important that it s an African American candidate as it is about a candidate that is going to be fair to the African American community said Aid Walter Burnett th head of the council s black caucus which met in private at the Hotel Allegro across from City Hall For anyone to run for mayor of the city of Chicago there has to be a groundswell of people in the city to support them Everyone has an opportunity At City Hall amid the swarm of politicians and reporters U S Rep Bobby Rush a South Side Democrat said it was critical to try to find an African American contender who would work for the black community s interests But the council s black caucus agreed only to try to come up with a list of topics such as improving education that prospective candidates should address Latino council members met for lunch and agreed to meet again within the next few weeks giving potential candidates time to develop a presentation to make to them If there s a Hispanic that runs he or she will probably get the majority of the Hispanic vote said Ald Danny Solis th I think more than likely it probably if you look at the numbers it won t be a Hispanic in the runoff Solis said But then I think we can play a very important role in backing one of the remaining candidates But such sentiments didn t deter one of the city s most prominent Latino politicians from declaring that he plans to run City Clerk del Valle told the Tribune he planned to make a formal announcement down the road Mell and many others expect the field for the city election will be too fragmented for any candidate to reach the winning margin of percent plus one vote If there is no outright winner the top two vote getters proceed to an runoff election One prominent Northwest Side committeeman who asked not to be identified because of the early stage of the campaigns said the measure of those candidates who are real and those who are seeking an ego boost can be measured in two numbers and million Though signatures are needed for the primary politicians routinely get double the number to ensure they make the ballot As for million the committeeman said about million would be needed to ensure a first or second place finish on Feb followed by a campaign of about million for the runoff I m getting a lot of calls about having lunch said the committeeman I ve told them to call me back when they get the signatures and then we can talk about fundraising Aid Patrick Levar th who is not running for mayor said this power vacuum reminds him of when Mayor Washington died and Eugene Sawyer was picked to replace him There s a lot of people who are going to be jockeying for position but I ve learned over the years to sit and listen and see who can put the different coalitions together said Levar who is also the Northwest Side ward s Democratic committeeman Whoever can raise the amount of money and put the coalition together is the person who is going to win While many politicians were starting those discussions some key Democratic committeemen said they hadn t heard from Emanuel one of the most prominent potential candidates Emanuel a former top political aide to Daley and Northwest Side congressman has previously said he d like to be mayor but has avoided the spotlight since Daley s announcement Gibbs the White House press secretary told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expected Emanuel to take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future But who previously served as Daley s political adviser told ABC News that if Emanuel decided to leave the White House for a mayoral bid the president will support that decision Saying mayors are larger than life personalities said Emanuel has that combination of skills and that personality and mindset to be a success if he chooses to go that route

4380,H: Got this poll done with Brock; Begala helped. Sid,http www politico com static PPM boehner html Our top message exposing Boehner as beholden to special interests beat the Republicans attack by points with swing voters Our second highest rated message connecting Karl Rove s secret efforts to hijack our elections to Boehner beat the Republican attack by points with swing voters and was the top rated message among Democratic likely voters Branding Boehner RAPIDRESPONSEMEMO OCTOBER ANALYST DREWWESTEN PH D WESTENSTRATEGIES Karl Rove is back in business directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to GOP campaigns to hijack our elections and our public discourse If he s successful Boehner will become Speaker of the House But the last thing Rove wants is for Boehner to be seen as the face of the GOP That s why he s claiming it s an inexplicable mistake for President Obama to put Boehner front and center Progressives know better than to take advice from Rove Our new message testing shows that progressives should not only talk about Boehner but define him and his agenda Every narrative we tested about Boehner from his loyalty to special interests and corporate donors over the interests of the middle class to Karl Rove s efforts to elevate him as Speaker beat the Republicans toughest attack language on Obama Pelosi and Reid Currently Boehner is largely unknown but when voters are told about him they don t like what they hear The following one liners beat GOP attack rhetoric by double digits with both likely and swing votersii The brief statements above beat this Republican attack Obama Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive government and destroyed our economy in the process Boehner and the Republicans won t let them continue Does Not Speak for Us or Our Values We need a Speaker who is also a listener who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans I The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency Unfortunately we know where Boehner s heart is and it ish t with the middle class C We need moderation not extremism If Boehner wants to speak for a party that has vowed to end Social Security Medicare and public education and force women who ve been raped to bear their rapist s child that s his business But he doesn t speak for America or American values Cares More about Interests LI Ordinary Americans need a Speaker for their interests not for the interests of billionaires and corporations that are outsourcing our jobs OIt s not hard to keep a tan like Boehner s when you re always out on the golf course with some CEO or lobbyist It s time we return to government of by and for the people not government of bought and paid for by special interests But in Boehner big business has finally found their man Helped Invent the Problems We Face OJohn Boehner understands deficits He s spent nearly years in Washington creating them OJohn Boehner knows the ways of Washington He helped invent them Earmarks deficits and tax breaks for corporations that outsource our jobs to China Branding Boehner Page KEYS TO CONNECTING Emphasize whose voices matter to Boehner Voters want a Speaker who listens to the voice of the people not the big corporations and lobbyists who Boehner represents Draw a strong contrast between the interests of working Americans and the special interests of powerful corporations Speak strongly to populist themes that focus on the loyalty of Boehner and the Republicans in Congress to their corporate donors like the tobacco CEOs whose campaign donations Boehner handed out on the House floor over the interests and values of ordinary Americans Focus on realities that are hard for Boehner to defend the social and economic extremism of his party and his long history in Washington helping to create the problems we face today NARRATIVES THAT BEAT THE GOP ATTACK Longer narratives against Boehner beat a similar but more in depth Republican message based on language drawn directly from Boehner and other conservative leaders Our top message exposing Boehner as beholden to special interests beat the Republicans attack by points with swing voters Our second highest rated message connecting Karl Rove s secret efforts to hijack our elections to Boehner beat the Republican attack by points with swing voters and was the top rated message among Democratic likely voters i We surveyed a national sample of adults matching the demographics of registered voters from using online dial testing We analyzed their responses as they listened to narratives to understand what they found compelling as well as their overall ratings of each narrative and additional one liners The numbers reported here are likely underestimates of the strength of the narratives as the statistics refer to the original narratives tested prior to revising them based on analysis of online dial tests ii Swing voters are defined as those who described themselves as anywhere from weak moderate Republicans through Independents to weak moderate Democrats THE REPUBLICAN ATTACK ON OBAMA PELOS AND REID Obama Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive and intrusive government and destroyed our economy in the process Democrats think they can get away with their job killing agenda by ramming it down people s throats excluding opposing viewpoints and eliminating fair debate They are turning their backs on American families and businesses as they continue to tax borrow and spend oblivion Boehner and the Republicans believe government should reflect the priorities of the American people priorities that have been ignored even mocked by the powers that be in Washington Obama Pelosi and Reid must be stopped from raising taxes on any American during a recession and spending money we don t have on big government programs no one wants Boehner and the Republicans are listening to the American people and understand that government is not the answer it s the problem Boehner and Rove After the Iraq War went south and the economy went under most of us thought we d never hear again from Karl Rove the architect of the Bush revolution But Rove is back in business directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to hijack our elections running ads against Members of Congress who want to put the public interest over the special interests He and Boehner aren t working for ordinary Americans They re working for the big corporations that outsource our jobs and get tax breaks for doing it Boehner s voted down the line for big bonuses for bankers big tax breaks for big oil and big loopholes for insurance companies that discriminate against people with pre existing conditions which is all of us if we just live long enough We should be restoring the American Dream for all Americans not just for the few and we need a Speaker who stands with the middle class They found their man We need to return to government of by and for the people not government of bought and paid for by special interests It s time billionaires and big businesses paid their fair share of taxes rather than paying politicians to give them special tax breaks and loopholes They re putting a lot of money Boehner and for good reason they know as Speaker he d speak for them not for ordinary Americans Just ask the tobacco company CEOs whose campaign donations he handed out on the floor of the House of Representatives which is supposed to be the People s House not the smokers lounge Or ask the bankers who played Russian roulette with our homes and jobs who got out their checkbooks as he and his fellow Republicans held a special meeting with them this summer promising to block any efforts to hold Wall Street accountable We need a Speaker whose voice is our voice who ll spend less time working on his tan and more time working on the problems of middle class Americans Boehner and Rove After the Iraq War went south and the economy went under most of us thought we d never hear again from Karl Rove the architect of the Bush revolution But Rove is back in business directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to hijack our elections running ads against Members of Congress who want to put the public interest

4381,"one more, and I'll stop bombarding you",I don t know if you had time to read the longer paper from Louise Diamond that I sent you but here she has boiled down her basic arguments words
4382,Fw:,Fyi
4383,Bill,It s worth you checking in with him before the meeting His quick report of meeting with Allawi Allawi said he pulled back from striking a deal with ISCI because he is concerned that the Shia representation is too small and there is too much difficulty in trying to widen Allawi asked bill if he thought Maliki was serious suggesting that he was toying with the idea of a grand coalition Allawi will see Barzani on the th Bill s overall take is that Allawi might now be looking to test the wider coalition proposition and is not as interested in the ISCI gambit as first option Bill has also seen AI Mahdi Talabani and Zebari He said there would be a good meeting with Maliki he s obviously feeling confident but was firm on limiting role of Sadrists and need to bring Iraqiyya inclusive govt
4384,Statement,You asked about this It was Walter Isaacson New BBG chief wants more money to combat enemies such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin PM The Broadcasting Board of Governors BBG has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson and the former CNN and Time magazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America s enemies which he identifies as Iran Venezuela Russia and China The BBG which oversees a million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world but at the same time is facing increased competition from other governments forays international broadcasting Isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress must allow the U S government to do the same We can t allow ourselves to be out communicated by our enemies he said You ve got Russia Today Iran s Press TV Venezuela s TeleSUR and of course China is launching an international broadcasting hour news channel with correspondents around the world and has reportedly set aside six to ten billion dollars we ve to go to Capitol with that number to expand their overseas media operations Isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that China and Iran were the prime targets China Iran and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies and Beijing has deployed armies of cyber militias to go after their country s cyber dissidents he said The BBG is at the forefront of combating this Through constant innovation and technical evolution our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway for audiences in China and Iran We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom Isaacson said Wherever there is a firewall it s our duty to storm it to denounce it and to circumvent it Isaacson was speaking at last week s th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe which he credited as contributing to the end of the Cold War He made it clear the BBG s outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively even if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration It s sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it s tasked with two separate missions that might conflict first of all covering the news with the highest journalistic standards and secondly being a part of America s public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the world Isaacson said Let me say to you my fellow journalists that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions our mission of being credible journalists because in fact it s the only way to carry out the second mission You can t do it unless you re credible and telling the truth and in the end the truth is on our side Pressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means especially in light of reports that the Obama administration sought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections Isaacson promised he wouldn t hesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations He said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about percent of the time as for the other percent a choice must be made I feel it s the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism just as you would in the private sector Isaacson said We can never compromise our credibility And in doing so that will probably help further the foreign policy interests of the United States But if it s ever a real conflict our goal one is to protect our credibility

4415,S/P staff member's article on Mario Vargas Llosa,I thought that you might enjoy this by our newest S P member who was a journalist for the Wall Street Journalist and other places before she joined us in She is on an International Fellowship from the Council on Foreign Relations They asked her to write the following it was cleared by L It is quite profound By EMILY PARKER In I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper We talked in his elegant home surrounded by thousands of books Mr Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine Then he proceeded to discuss why he believes that literature can change the world Mr Vargas Llosa s Nobel Prize is a great victory and not just for a talented and prolific author His work is perhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics or who claim that they have no time for fiction In a New Republic essay in Mr Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature an important place in the life of nations He wrote Without it the critical mind which is the real engine of historical change and the best protector of liberty would suffer an irreparable loss Mr Vargas Llosa s novels reflect his deep personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value of individual liberty He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes but I would argue that he is among the most successful Columnist Mary Anastasia O Grady on the anti Communist Peruvian writer A case in point is Conversation in the Cathedral the work that Mr Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue first from a fire The novel is set in Peru in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the s which is when Mr Vargas Llosa grew up He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how dictatorships impregnate every act of life To demonstrate this Mr Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright The book opens with a grim landscape of uneven and faded buildings and describes dull and defeated eyes at the tables of Zela bar hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer The narrative which rapidly jumps from past to present describes a stalled confused world You don t know who to trust Mr Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in The Feast of the Goat which explicitly details the horrors of the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women and so we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path The woman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship Mr Vargas Llosa told me For some Mr Vargas Llosa s victory will be controversial because of his political background and his outspoken views He unsuccessfully ran for president of Peru in losing to Alberto Fujimori During the campaign Mr Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy free trade and private property He was no less controversial for his support of the invasion of Iraq which he saw as necessary to ending what he called the monstrous dictatorship of Saddam Hussein Mr Vargas Llosa has now left politics and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen Or as he told me in Lima Through writing one can change history Not all of his work is dark Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is punctuated with humor and The Bad Girl about one man s world wide pursuit of an elusive lover is a thoroughly entertaining read The one constant is a perceptive and empathetic glimpse a wide range of human experience As Mr Vargas Llosa wrote in his essay about literature Nothing better protects a human being against the stupidity of prejudice racism religious or political sectarianism and exclusivist nationalism than this truth that invariably appears in great literature that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal Ms Parker is an international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations

4444,Re: InterAction op-ed on branding in Pakistan,I agree As you know I believe passionately that it is not in our national interests to continue to provide billions of dollars in aid and assistance without the very people we are helping knowing we are the ones providing the assistance Some of our research in Pakistan indicates that many people believe the assistancee is coming from China and of course the Chinese do nothing to correct the record I asked INR to provide me with an assessment of the current situation after the floods to determine the impact of our assistance I have also asked them to work with the IC to give us an accurate and unbiased assessment of the security risks involved I aksed for it a couple of weeks ago so hopefully they will have something we can use now which might be helpful in drafting a response In terms of the security arguments he makes it is worth noting that the incidents he references are situations where the attacks occured in places where there was NO USG branding The reality is that the terrorists attack any group or institution which might impede their ability to prevail I had already planned a USAID State meeting to address this issue this week I ll try to get everyone together today or tomorrow and will report back to you

4475,Re: H: The Boehner poll. Sid,Did this with Sean Sid The Political Scene Confounding Fathers The Tea Party s Cold War roots by Sean Wilentz ann Beck s view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties A few months ago the cable television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite props a pipe clenched between his teeth I ve got my pipe he told his audience his speech slightly muddled by the stem because we re going to speak about schoolish kind of things The theme of the day was Restoring History and Beck looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button down shirt began the lesson by peering at a stack of history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods produced by malicious progressive intent Progressives he explained liberals socialists Communists the entire spectrum of the left knew they had to separate us from our history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God For the next hour Beck earnestly explained some of the history that is being stolen from us the depression of for example or how conservative economics saved the nation from the near depression of crises that progressives don t want you to know about You ve been taught one lie I think your whole life he said For the fractious Tea Party movement Beck a former drive time radio jockey a recovering alcoholic and a Mormon convert has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide One opinion poll released in by Democracy Corps showed that he is the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters seen not merely as an entertainer like Rush Limbaugh but as an educator And in the past few months Beck has established his own institute of learning the online for profit Beck University Enrollees can take courses like Faith which contends with revisionists and secular progressives about the separation of church and state Hope an attack on the activist federal government and the combined Charity a highly restrictive interpretation of rights federalism and the division of powers During the Restoring History episode Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars where they can hear lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find The B U faculty consists of three members including one bona fide academic R Stoner Jr the chair of the political science department at Louisiana State University the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders which the Web site calls a national pro family organization Beck himself often acts as a professor a slightly jocular one on his Fox News program Surrounded by charts and figures he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons about the country s long march to Obama era totalitarianism The decline he says began with the Progressive era of the early twentieth century in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson when both the Federal Reserve System and the graduated federal income tax came existence Wilson Beck told his radio audience in just despised what America was Beck s claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers At the movement s Freedom Summit in Washington last one activist told a reporter The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson in was when it started going downhill And in an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from Cape Fear North Carolina claimed on the group s Web site that the very things you see happening in this country today started with the Wilson Administration At a Tax Day rally this past spring the veteran conservative organizer Viguerie described the Tea Party as an unfettered new force of the middle class And indeed calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement or at least a new twist in the nation s long history of conspiracy mongering In fact it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago especially in the Birch Society and among its admirers Beck s version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration the late right wing writer W Cleon Skousen and also restates charges made by the Birch Society s founder Welch The political universe is of course very different today from what it was during the Cold War Yet the Birchers politics and their view of American history which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist China has proved remarkably persistent The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades inside the Republican Party have exploded anew and why this time Party leaders have done virtually nothing to challenge those ideas and a great deal to abet them The early nineteen sixties were a turbulent time in American politics for the right wing in particular In the South racist violence against civil rights workers was constant deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans Southern elected officials in support of what they called massive resistance to civil rights laws and judicial rulings resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition which claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders Others focussed on what they considered a fearsome Communist menace inside the United States General Edwin A Walker caused an enormous stir when he resigned from the Army in after President F Kennedy s Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right wing propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies Senator Strom Thurmond the Dixiecrat from South Carolina spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly liberal domestic programs fall clearly within the category of socialism The Birch Society was one of the decade s most controversial right wing organizations Founded in by Welch a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in whom Welch called the first American casualty of the Cold War The group was founded at a propitious time After Senator Joseph McCarthy s fall in many of McCarthy s followers felt bereft of a voice and Welch seemed to speak for them by the mid sixties his society s membership was estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand Welch exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an immense domestic conspiracy declared that the federal government had already fallen the Communists clutches In a tract titled The Politician he attacked President Dwight D Eisenhower as a dedicated conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy who had been serving the plot all of his adult life Late in after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion he accused the Kennedy Administration of helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the opposite Wherever he looked Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on of totalitarianism But within the United States he believed the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik Revolution Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism Welch described government as always and inevitably an enemy of individual freedom Consequently he charged the Progressive era which expanded the federal government s role in curbing social and economic ills was a dire period in our history and Woodrow Wilson more than any other one man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism In the nineteen sixties Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but a tool of the total conspiracy This master conspiracy he said had forerunners in ancient Sparta and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth century in the uniformly Satanic creed and program of the Bavarian Illuminati Run by those he called the Insiders the conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers government agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service and nongovernmental organizations like the Bilderberg Group the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission Since the early twentieth century they had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift One broad avenue down which these conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation Welch declared in The very same collectivist theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new and modern concepts In the worst case Welch believed military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians But for the moment a nonviolent political revolution would suffice Accordingly he designed the Birch Society roughly if not explicitly on the Marxist Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the populace and elect right thinking candidates to office It isn t numbers we have to worry about Welch wrote but the courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough the same as the Communists do The Founder himself would dictate the society s policies advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and professionals and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders It is the leadership that is most demanding most exacting of its followers Welch observed that achieves really dedicated support Welch s group became synonymous with right wing extremism earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie The trumpeter whose actual name was Birks Gillespie made a humorous run for the Presidency in organizing Birks Societies in twenty five states Still the most outlandish of the era s right wing anti Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen A transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens Skousen was considered so radical in the early nineteen sixties that even J Edgar Hoover s F B I watched him closely one memo in his extensive F B I file noted that during the past year or so Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right wing professional communists who are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes Skousen was himself employed by the F B I from until much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration These desk jobs he claimed implausibly gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism Skousen also maintained that he had served as Hoover s administrative assistant Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University interrupted by a stint from to as the police chief of Salt Lake City His time in office was contentious and after he raided a friendly card game attended by the city s right wing mayor J Bracken Lee he was promptly fired Lee called Skousen a master of half truths and said that he ran the police department like a Gestapo Skousen s supporters placed burning crosses on the Mayor s lawn After losing his police job Skousen founded a group called the All American Society which Time described in as an exemplar of the far right ultras Although he did not join the Birch Society Skousen worked with its American Opinion Speakers Bureau and in wrote a rousing tract titled The Communist Attack on the Birch Society which condemned the society s critics for promoting the official Communist Party line This was a tic of Skousen s he later defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called The Communist Attack on the Mormons All along Skousen s evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch s In The Naked Communist a lengthy primer published in he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims writing that F D R s adviser Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium and that the Russians built the first Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States A year before Condon s novel The Manchurian Candidate appeared Skousen announced that the Communists were creating a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds could be triggered immediate action by signals from their masters A later book The Naked Capitalist decried the Ivy League Establishment who through the Federal Reserve the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller Foundation formed the world s secret power structure The conspiracy had begun Skousen wrote when reformers like the wealthy banker Edward M Colonel House a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson helped put place the Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax In Skousen organized another group the Freemen Institute which he later renamed the National Center for Constitutional Studies According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research the center s targets included the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the Environmental Protection Agency the Federal Communication Commission s fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting the federal government s change of the gold standard in currency all subsidies to farmers all federal aid to education all federal social welfare foreign aid social security elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading and that familiar right wing nemesis the United Nations Skousen s pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists including some on the right wing fringe In the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out because members felt that he had gone off the deep end In a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of inventing fantastic ideas and making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary and advancing doctrines that came perilously close to Nazism And in after Skousen called President Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller family the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his organizations Skousen was undeterred In he produced The Year Leap a treatise that assembles selective quotations and groundless assertions to claim that the U S Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible and that the framers believed in minimal central government Either proposition would have astounded Madison often described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution who rejected state established religions and like Alexander Hamilton proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws The Year Leap is not a fervid book Instead it is calmly ingratiatingly misleading Skousen quotes various eighteenth century patriots on the evils of what Adams in called the Utopian schemes of leveling which Skousen equates with redistribution of wealth But he does not mention the Founders endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare Jefferson for example wrote approvingly in of having federal taxes then limited to tariffs fall solely on the wealthy which meant that the farmer will see his government supported his children educated and the face of his country made a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state asserting that the Founders were not indulging in any idle gesture when they adopted the motto In God We Trust In reality the motto that came out of the Constitutional Convention was E Pluribus Unum out of many one In God We Trust came much later its use on coins was first permitted in and only in at the height of the Cold War did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency The following year President Eisenhower who Welch charged was a Communist agent approved In God We Trust as the national motto In Skousen published a follow up work an ancestor worshipping history text titled The Making of America and prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative study of Beck Common Nonsense the new book became an object of controversy in after the California Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund raising drive Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from long disgraced work by the historian Fred A which characterized slave children as pickaninnies and suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove of Stanford inspected Skousen s book and seminars and pronounced them a joke that no self respecting scholar would think is worth a warm pitcher of spit By the time Skousen died in he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest right Mormons Then in Glenn Beck began touting his work The Naked Communist The Naked Capitalist and especially The Year Leap which he called essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did After Beck put the book in the first spot on his required reading list and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue it shot to the top of the Amazon best seller list In the first half of it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand copies Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots the United American Tea Party and other groups across the country have since organized study groups around it It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding Fathers a United American Tea Party video declares referring to the principles expounded by Skousen s book If Beck is the movement s teacher The Year Leap has become its primer with The Making of America as a kind of level text The popularity of Beck s broadcasts which now reach two million viewers each day has brought neo Birchite ideas to an audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of Several times a week Beck informs his audience that socialists whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists led by Obama have seized power and that patriotic Americans must take their country back His TV show for some time featured Comrade Updates in which Beck described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background He attacks all the familiar bogeymen the Federal Reserve System which he asserts is a private conglomerate unaccountable to the public the Council on Foreign Relations born of a progressive idea to manipulate the media in order to let the masses know what should be done and a historical procession of evildoers including Skousen s old target Colonel House and Welch s old target Woodrow Wilson His sources on these matters quite apart from Skousen s books can be unreliable On nd amid a diatribe about House Beck cited a passage from Secrets of the Federal Reserve by Eustace Mullins The book commissioned in by Ezra Pound is a startlingly anti Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish led conspiracy of all powerful bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world Part of Beck s allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information In one segment last year he produced a drawing of fasces which he described anachronistically as the Roman symbol of Fascism and then a picture of an old Mercury dime with fasces on the reverse side Who brought this dime in It happened in Woodrow Wilson was the President he said We ve been on the road to Fascism for a while Benito Mussolini of course didn t adopt the ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen twenties the designer of the coin the sculptor Adolph A Weinman intended it to signify the nation s military preparedness and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate the desire for peace Beck s readings of Progressive era politics are nearly as bizarre Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt he was not a crypto radical It was Roosevelt who coined the term lunatic fringe to describe the extreme leftists of his day and his concept of New Nationalism in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism partly by regulating big business looked back to Alexander Hamilton not Karl Marx Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik in fact in he sent American troops to Russia to support the anti Bolshevik White Army At home his reforms sought to break up monopolies in order to restore competition among small companies If America is not to have free enterprise Wilson declared then she can have no freedom of any sort whatever In Beck then the host of Glenn Beck on CNN s Headline News brought to his show a Birch Society spokesman named Sam Antonio who warned of a government plot to abolish U S borders with Mexico and Canada and eventually all throughout the Americas Beck told Antonio When I was growing up the Birch Society I thought they were a bunch of nuts But now he said you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me His guest beamed Yes we at the Birch Society are not nuts Antonio said We are just exposing the truth that s been out there for many many years Since then the Birch Society s Web site has run clips from Beck s Fox broadcasts proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas Last an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on Communism in America as the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American history Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson one of Skousen s close associates Benson the Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints gained notoriety for a speech in in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals including the historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr as socialists and Communist sympathizers warned that the Constitution will be endangered and hang as it were by a single thread and praised the Birch Society as the most effective non church organization in our fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism Last Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech intoning Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming The Birch Society s Web site subsequently praised Beck for getting progressively sorry for the bad word choice closer to presenting American history in the way that The Birch Society has been doing it for over years Beck is no more the sole representative of today s multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen sixties far right he recently told the Times a bit disingenuously that he was not involved with the Tea Party Why then have the politics of Skousen Benson and the Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative Republicans not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle Last month Angle gave a warm address to a freedom conference in Salt Lake City co sponsored by the Birch Society and Skousen s old group the National Center for Constitutional Studies praising her audience as mainstream America and patriots who had heard the call The columnist Frank Rich among others has suggested that the election of a black President sowed fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in the country There are signs that this is so Republicans singling out of Thurgood as an activist Justice during Elena Kagan s Supreme Court confirmation hearings the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the minuscule New Black Panther Party But socialist is not a racial slur Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal Reserve and the I R S The Tea Party s fulminations against cap and trade federal government bailouts and big government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama s skin The current right wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half century In the nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties the far right was condemned by liberals as might be expected in President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those discordant voices of extremism that equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state the welfare state with socialism and socialism with Communism But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives who feared being perceived as paranoids and conspiracy mongers The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti Bircher conservatives was F Buckley Jr the editor of National Review Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism He was a lifelong defender of Joseph McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was set by a socialist conspiracy and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced practical conservatives their chance at national power By his biographer B Judis writes Buckley was beginning to worry that with the Birch Society growing so rapidly the right wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly even Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted In the next two decades with Buckley s support and counsel Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians Buckley had far more political influence than might be expected from the editor of a weekly journal Yet in the early nineteen sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their fellow travellers extremely difficult Even though some of Buckley s colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch Society went too far they would not attack the society publicly for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the conservatives who sympathized with their views When Buckley wrote an editorial in that accused Welch of distorting reality and failing to make the crucial moral and political distinction between Communists and liberals the magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support By Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans and he consulted closely with Buckley At a meeting at the Breakers hotel in Palm Beach in Buckley urged Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society Goldwater demurred though he conceded that some embarrassing kooks lurked among the Birchers he insisted to Buckley that there were also some nice guys and that it would be injudicious to attack the group in public The Birchers support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue In the general election though Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson partly because Democrats succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right To the Goldwater slogan In Your Heart You Know He s Right the Democrats shot back In Your Guts You Know He s Nuts Buckley s fears had been confirmed But he was undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement In he favored Nixon among a field of Republican aspirants He liked Ronald Reagan s politics but considered Reagan who had only recently been elected the governor of California too new to national politics Romney the governor of Michigan a wishy washy moderate was obviously unsuitable to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller of New York Nixon was a hard nosed Republican with strong conservative views especially on Communism and the Cold War he had established himself as a Communist hunter in the nineteen forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss a former official at the State Department had spied for the Soviets And promisingly Nixon was the front runner It seems to me that we ought to have a real chance of winning this year Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National Convention He served the campaign as an adviser and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare who had taken charge of Nixon s media operations But Buckley s candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum Some of the editors of National Review recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G O P nomination in didn t sufficiently trust him And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom Welch had called one of the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene As President in Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious appeasers When he visited Beijing in even Buckley was deeply offended But when the general election took place later that year with the antiwar Democratic candidate McGovern voicing the country s anxieties over Vietnam Buckley and the mainstream of what he called responsible conservatism returned to Nixon The purist conservatives were left to back the third party candidacy of Schmitz a Republican congressman and a member of the Birch Society Nixon won in a landslide and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations The conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power And despite the embarrassment of Watergate in Nixon s second term their strategy proved effective over time Nixon s campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam and Buckley wrote revealed that the Democrats had an indifference toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom Meanwhile the Buckley mainstream having read the Birchers out of the conservative movement established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican Party and in national politics In Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan s primary challenge to Nixon s successor Gerald Ford After two terms as governor Reagan had matured what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician a shrewd leader as well as a man of principle Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of Orange County and Reagan was adept at winning extremists allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies His pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in when he chose the relatively moderate H W Bush his bitter foe during the primaries as his running mate Though the decision dismayed right wing ideologues it had two practical benefits it instantly healed the divisions between Republican moderates and conservatives and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right winger Nobody was more pleased by Bush s selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man F Buckley who understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had As President Reagan flattered the extremists he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen s Freemen Institute but he saved his political capital for his real goals undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal style government and redirecting U S foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world He appointed moderates to positions of importance as when he made Baker III Bush s close associate his first chief of staff rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III his former chief of staff from California As a top policy adviser Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and Baker s deputy the pragmatic Reaganite Deaver and his crusade as Attorney General to roll back civil rights legislation largely failed When zealots in the Administration were exposed as in the Iran Contra scandal Reagan skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans And when he recognized in Mikhail Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat Reagan pushed forward ignoring the complaints that he had become in the hard liner Howard Phillips s phrase a useful idiot for Soviet propaganda Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the federal tax code a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary and a near victory for the West in the Cold War From the standpoint of the mainstream right the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to matching his public appeal and political savvy For the party of Reagan his departure was the beginning of a long decline and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure during the past twenty years that has allowed the current resurgence of extremism H W Bush repelled right wingers with his moderate tendencies not least when in the face of fiscal calamity he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of attacks and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment personified by Senator Bob Dole to check some of the wildest charges the new Republican House majority after pushed by such ideologues as Tom DeLay and Dick Armey had little interest in maintaining the center They harassed Clinton forcing an impeachment even though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved W Bush seemed at first to have a bit of Reagan s conservative charisma but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq for his moderate position on immigration and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial collapse in When F Buckley died during the primary season it seemed to symbolize the end of a conservative era Klinghoffer a former literary editor at National Review lamented that urbane visionaries and builders of institutions such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures who make their money by stirring fears and resentments Conservatism Klinghoffer added has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism and is now ruled by those he called the crazy cons Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition but to little effect The commentator Frum a former speechwriter for W Bush lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the Republicans obstruction of health care reform and called the right wing surge a threat to conservatism In the congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush s financial bailout lost a vicious primary fight with a right wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy To his amazement Inglis was confronted on the campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had bought them at birth And then of course he recalls it turned something about the Federal Reserve and the Bilderbergers and all that stuff Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers Appearing on Fox News the night of the recent primaries he described the Tea Party backed Senate candidate in Delaware Christine O Donnell as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were nutty Instantly criticism came from Sarah Palin Rush Limbaugh and other right wing Republicans Within days he was back on Fox proclaiming himself a huge Tea Party fan endorsing O Donnell and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give her its full backing So far Rove an unlikely dissident is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward as Buckley and his allies did Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside as have such former G O P stalwarts as Charlie Crist in Florida and Mike Castle in Delaware both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates Grist is now running a long shot campaign as an Independent Desperate for gains in the midterm elections the Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan Fifty years ago President Kennedy deplored the far right s counsels of fear and suspicion Today Obama s White House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies In the absence of forthright leadership on both the right and the left the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate Candidates like O Donnell may prove too eccentric to prevail or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of government After the election mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Viguerie has forecast as a massive almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party Already Rove and some leading Bush political operatives including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie have been quietly supplanting the battered G O P establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year s candidates But according to a recent poll more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party and it seems almost certain that a Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the coming midterm elections In early in the Progressive era the humorist Finley Peter Dunne s fictional barroom sage Mr Dooley put the social and political tumult of the day perspective Th noise ye hear is not th first gun iv a revolution Dooley remarked It s on y th people iv th United States batin a carpet A century from now or even a year from now Americans may say the same about the Tea Party For the moment though it appears that the extreme right wing is on

4476,Re: H: The Boehner poll. Sid,This is the distilled pure and utterly conventional wisdom of much of the DC political chattering class at this moment The first two paragraphs are the most important completely accurate in assessment the rest twaddle Oct Why Obama Is Losing the Political War By Mark Halperin Barack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise From above by elite opinion about his competence From below by mass anger and anxiety over unemployment And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after s elections With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists most politically engaged elites have reached the same conclusions the White House is in over its head isolated insular arrogant and clueless about how to get along with or persuade members of Congress the media the business community or working class voters This view is held by Fox News pundits executives and anchors at the major old media outlets reporters who cover the White House Democratic and Republican congressional leaders and governors many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised big money for Obama in and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle See Obama s troubled first year issue by issue On after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data the last major jobs figures before the midterms Obama said Putting the American people back to work expanding opportunity rebuilding the economic security of the middle class is the moral and national challenge of our time But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challenge and are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term Moreover there is a growing perception that Obama s decisions are causing harm that businesses are being hurt by the Administration s legislation and that economic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy health care deficits housing immigration and spending And that sentiment is spreading Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama s capacity to turn things around especially but not exclusively those inclined to dislike him Tea Partyers and McCain voters but also tens of millions of middle class Americans including quite a few who turned out for Obama in See how some Americans are facing the prospect of long term unemployment The misery afflicting the country

Dayton career fair says starkly There are no jobs A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration I ve been looking for a job now for months Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time the breadlines for the Obama years Most of Obama s private and sometimes public rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to stave off a worldwide depression His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans even the proposals based on policies supported by the GOP in the past His opponents haven t put forth specifics of their own nor offered genuine compromise while the media have allowed the right s activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without furnishing legitimate alternative solutions See Barack Obama s top sound bites But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the economy around but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from the problems at hand He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a clear optimistic fashion defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years health care and the Troubled Asset Relief Program for example and explaining what he would do with a re elected Democratic majority to spur growth Throughout the year we have been treated to Obama led attacks on W Bush and Dick Cheney Rush Limbaugh Congressman Joe Barton for his odd apology to BP Boehner for seeking the speakership or was it something about an ant and Fox News for everything Suitable Democratic targets in some cases perhaps but not worth the time of a busy Commander in Chief In the past few days we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his top advisers wading allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered through the Chamber of Commerce combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative television commercials Not only is this issue convoluted and far fetched but it also distracts from the issues voters care about frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens not that many are following such an offbeat story line Feinting and gibing can t obscure those job numbers See the best viral campaign ads of The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures the stimulus spending the auto company rescue the health care law and the financial regulation effort that someday may be seen as brave and bold the foundation for a better economy Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen But the President was correct when he said the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is You re hired and that s still not occurring for too many Americans The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections everything changes in Republicans will have a greater obligation politically and morally to help govern rather than thwart and badger The President will get a chance in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal to show he is turning the page on the political horrors of for his party and the nation But before then Republicans are almost certainly going to demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama Administration hasn t much to offer either except more of the same that isn t working Find this article at http www time com time golitics article html Copyright

4478,"Rothkopf on Jones, et al",http www foreignpolicy com articles goodbye mr jones Goodbye Mr And good riddance Why Jim was the worst national security advisor in decades BY DAVID J ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER The president s inexperience did in more than any of the general s deficits He didn t know what he wanted He vacillated on key issues He simply demonstrated the problems America repeatedly has when it hires men with no foreign policy background to take on the most important international job in the world Further he did not really know enough about how the presidency works to nip in the bud the creation of the inner circle bubble that effectively negated much of the work that the formal policy process did Obama encouraged or tolerated for long enough that it looks like encouragement his campaign foreign policy deputies to continue to report directly to him and this led to some public and private backdooring of that undercut his authority dramatically He did not empower and that combined with s own shortcomings led to the zero chemistry ineffective collaboration that has been openly criticized by senior White House and foreign policy officials since the spring of Obama s first year in office In fact the situation got so bad that was publicly undercut by true Obama confidante more than once It is something of a surprise he lasted this long As one former national security advisor said to me while we were discussing a well known instance of publicly undercutting That would have only happened once on my watch It would have been me or him
4479,H: FYI. Sid,The Huffington Post oward Fineman finemanAhuffingtonpost com I HuffPost Reporting The Power Of Clinton The Invisibility Of Obama First Posted PM I Updated PM LOUISVILLE I see that Dr Rand has taken out after Bill Clinton dredging up Lewinsky And I know why did so The former president was here in Kentucky yesterday and in this state as in many others he is a far more potent and popular foe than President Barack Obama On my first day working for The Huffington Post I came back to Kentucky where I began my career many years ago at the Courier Journal The people who run the University of Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted me to do an on stage interview with a certain best selling author who is also my new boss Arianna Huffington It was a tricky mix of professional incest and personal nostalgia but the event worked out well and I also got a chance to play Kentucky reporter once again out in the state I raced over to Lexington and here is the ground level outside the Beltway reality I witnessed Like Voldemort s Obama s is a name no one dares utter and that includes Clinton speaking to Democrats At a sunny noontime rally on the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington yesterday the former president made a stirring well argued case for Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway and for Democrats generally without once mentioning Obama and rarely mentioning the presidency It was as though we suddenly had only two branches of government To be fair almost no one else at the one hour rally mentioned the sitting president And Kentucky is staunch Republican territory We re farther ahead in the generic ballot here than ever GOP Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told me yesterday President Obama was never popular here even at his peak Still the eerie invisibility of the president is a telling commentary on the Democrats confused divided and defensive predicament as they brace for the verdict of the voters on Election Day Nov There was something odd and if you re a Democrat depressing about a former Democratic president avoiding any mention of his Democratic successor Clinton sincerely wants to help out on the trail and certainly wants to avoid the accusation that he didn t try to help But his travels have turned a personal victory lap that often makes him not the candidate he s touting the center of attention That was true here in Kentucky The rally s mechanics were mostly handled by the Secret Service more to the point the final and therefore top billed speaker wasn t Conway It was Clinton The Conway people didn t mind They were glad to have him Rail thin but not frail wearing a tweedy professorial sports coat and his signature rueful knowing smile Clinton was treated with a respect bordering on awe His familiar mane of white hair thinning now was translucent in the sun giving him an almost otherworldly look the Sage from a Better Age Clinton is beloved In Kentucky He won the state twice He speaks the local dialect which contains Appalachian notes of working class pride suspicion of big shots and Baptist revivalism But more than that and more than just in Kentucky Clinton s economic record million jobs created and he tends not to forget to mention the looks spectacularly good in the context of what has followed These days there is almost an Old Testament milk and honey reverence for that economic record at least as expressed by former Kentucky Sen Wendell Ford An old school podium pounder Ford stooped but still strong voiced at talked of the former president in messianic terms Bill Clinton found us the path to gold he shouted The crowd of most of them students didn t laugh They seemed to think he was right How any of this helps Obama is far from clear it isn t even clear that it helps many Democrats since they d be joining the same Washington party that the current president ostensibly heads But Clinton is all too happy to show Obama how it s done As a campaigner and as president Clinton s gift was his ability to untangle the knots of even the most complex policy issue and explain it in plain language to people suspicious of the powerful but eager not to be screwed by them or to be seen as dupes Republicans and their corporate allies were out to shut down the few good things that government does for you he said in the name of balancing a budget that they themselves destroyed I gave you budget surpluses Clinton said as if this had been an act of personal beneficence Knowing his audience the former president focused on Pell Grants and on a new program that allows graduates to pay back their loans over longer periods and at lower rates he said will try to take that new program away and given the GOP s deliberate vagueness about spending cuts there is reason to think Clinton is right Which is why got personal today Which means Clinton drew blood Which means that he did what he came to do Which means Obama will remain invisible at least in Kentucky at least for now and probably for a long time to come Ci

4503,just a little self-promotion,I know I m not supposed to lift my head from the QDDR but just thought you would like to see this it s for all the ideas you wanted promoted when you picked me AM The Crossroads Nation By DAVID BROOKS Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the st century President Obama talks about laying down a new foundation But Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like and Obama is vague about what edifice is going to go on top of that foundation They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in or Nobody has quite defined America s coming economic identity In thinking about this question it probably helps to start at the beginning Five hundred years ago agriculture was the major economic activity One hundred years ago it was industrial production Now of course we re living in an information age Innovation and creativity are the engines of economic growth Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person She comes from a little place somewhat removed from the center of power and influence As an adolescent she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle She moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests She gets involved with a team to create something amazing Then at some point she finds her own problem which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her group She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing She brings it back to her circle It is tested refined and improved The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process It happens within networks It happens when talented people get together when idea systems and mentalities merge Now imagine you are this creative person in the year or You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or some other place foreign or domestic You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you are thinking about creating the things you want to create If you are passionate about fashion maybe you will go to Paris If it s engineering maybe it ll be Germany But if you are passionate about many other spheres I suspect you ll want to be in America You ll want to be in the U S because English has become the global language You ll want to come because American universities lead the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth You ll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption Intellectual property is protected Huge venture capital funds already exist Moreover the United States is a universal nation There are already people there with connections all over the world A nation of immigrants is more permeable than say Chinese society You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks ones that are flexible and intense Study after study suggests that America is one of those societies with high social trust Americans build large efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of kinship and clan Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical American children are raised to challenge their parents American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses In this country you re less likely to have to submit to authority From this story you can see that economic power in the st century is not going to look like economic power in the th century The crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs Information networks need junction points The nation that can make itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power In Anne Marie now director of policy planning at the State Department wrote an essay for Foreign in which she laid out the logic of this new situation In a networked world the issue is no longer relative power but centrality in an increasingly dense global web s essay was titled America s Edge That is apt Americans are now in a depressed state of mind As China and India rise nearly two thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline In fact the U S is well situated to be the crossroads nation It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right kinds of networks Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections finance research to attract scientists improve infrastructure to ease travel fix immigration to funnel talent reform taxes to attract superstars make study abroad a rite of passage for college students take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age There s no reason to be pessimistic about that

International politics United States democracy power american power the world rise of the new right The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama

Max begin of the skype highlighting end of the skype highlighting author of Republican Gomorrah enters the heady world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities feverish rhetoric toxic hatreds and flirtation with violence that fuel its sub culture s insurgent activism He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself Since the Republic is weak he is led to break the law out of love for obedience But is it really strong authority that he wishes In reality he demands rigorous order for others and for himself disorder without responsibility Jean Sartre Anti Semite and Jew I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack Obama era It might have been in when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada Perusing tables piled high with high calibre semi automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity I heard urgent warnings of mass roundups concentration camps and a socialist government in Washington These people that are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what s going on in this country a gun dealer told me outside a show in Reno Good luck Obama a young gun enthusiast remarked to me We outnumber him to At this time the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media s radar In I led a panel discussion at the University of California Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah Basic Nation Books Inside an auditorium filled with nearly students and faculty I sat alongside Jonathan Walton an African American professor of religious studies and prolific writer and Mark Takano an erudite openly gay former Democratic congressional candidate and local community college trustee In the middle of our discussion a dozen college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a left wing hack while a hysterical young man leaped from the crowd blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a racist Afterward university police officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right wing heckler attempted to follow me as he shouted threats Who was this stalker Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit the Intercollegiate Studies Institute Besides founding dozens of Republican youth groups across the country Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in homosexuals His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax arguing that homosexuality is at once a curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists Adding to his credentials Sorba has a history of run ins with the law he explained when I called him about the order My encounter with this aggressive right wing cadre seemed a strange isolated event But the hostility turned out to be symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress The right s days of rage were only beginning The constellation Through his first year in office Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right He campaigned against partisanship declaring that there were no red states and no conservative America Apparently he thought it was merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science demonised gays assailed minority and women s rights not that they genuinely believed in what they said Speaking of changing Washington Obama seemed to think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain divisive personalities easily wiped away with gestures toward bipartisanship His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but separated by partisans The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together Many of his supporters in the media often partisans of political wars over the years reinforced and amplified his innocence proclaiming he was the one at last who could bridge the partisan divide a disaffected conservative who once called critics of W Bush policies fifth columnists but now fervently supported Obama wrote that the new president was destined to become a liberal Reagan who can reunite America This optimism pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes After all why couldn t we all just get along In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views Once he was elected conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama s strength by transforming him a human tableau for the most fearsome images they could conjure see Barack Obama the fallen messiah Obama s multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock troops Those who rejected Obama s legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the Birther movement that sought to challenge his citizenship The movement s most visible figure and therefore the most eccentric was Orly Taitz a dentist and self trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling in the conservative bastion of Orange County California Convinced by claims on the far right website WorldNetDaily that Obama planned to create a civilian national security force Taitz told me she realised that Obama was another Stalin it s a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler s Germany After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama s family had forged his birth certificate in Hawaii Taitz snapped action She filed a lawsuit in with California s secretary of state Debra Bowen demanding an investigation Obama s eligibility to serve as president Taitz s plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake an Orange County radio preacher and former second vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly prayed for Obama s death While her lawsuit went nowhere and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges Taitz became an instant media sensation delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers from Sean Hannity to CNN s Lou Dobbs the latter described by Taitz as her greatest supporter was eventually fired as an indirect result of his hosting of her In the Texas Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign The Birther movement had found its voice in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots By of Republican respondents to a Kos Research poll said they thought Obama wasn t born in the United States while weren t sure Obama should be in the Big House Taitz shrieked to me not the White House When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration the conservative movement activated a campaign of demonisation transformational politics designed to turn Obama the Other making him seem as unfamiliar and therefore as threatening as possible When the president urged the Congress to deliver a healthcare reform bill in the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama s dream of bipartisanship a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss s MaraVSade On tens of thousands of far right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on Washington s National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan The date was significant Fox News s top ranked talk show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the Project to restore the sense of unity and siege mentality that Americans experienced on But this time Obama not Osama was the enemy While covering the rally I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America s security than al Qaida demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama s face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden others carried signs questioning Obama s status as a United States citizen We can fight al Qaida we can t kill Obama said an aging demonstrator Another told me Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world pointing to placards he had fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits According to another activist Obama s agenda was similar to Hitler s Hitler took over the banking industry did he not And Hitler had his own personal secret service police The community organising group Acorn is an extension of that The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right wing Jewish settlers during rallies against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process portraying him as an SS officer and as the French collaborator Petain In amid this provocative atmosphere a young right wing Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence Members of the Tea Party Patriots did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational or that comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic Their motives were entirely negative By purging government of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means several activists told me they believed Acorn helped Obama steal the election they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return They had no interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda much less discussing the merits of policies The Tea Party s primary concern was cultural purification freedom from not freedom to Against the dark image of the president and his liberal allies Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light The racial subtext was always transparent The Tea Party s strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform The Tea Paters were convinced this would be an easy feat since they believed the majority of the country was on their side that they represented the real America At the rally Matt Kibbe one of the march organisers told the crowd that ABC News was reporting that million to million people were in attendance ABC denied this saying ABCNews com reported an approximate figure of to protesters Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of Freedom works Freedom works Unknown to most of the Tea Paters they were intoning the name of a corporate funded Beltway advocacy group not the battle cry of Mel Gibson s version of Wallace in Bra veheart Indeed contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites the Tea Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry funded conservative groups with close Republican ties The movement s leading puppet master was the same Dick Armey who directed resources and talking points to the Tea Party Patriots from his Washington based advocacy group FreedomWorks Among the corporate clients of Armey s lobbying firm which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties was the pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform Armey s other real American clients included the Marxist terror cult the People s Mojahedin of Iran which received funding and assistance from Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the s against Iranian civilian targets Armey collected a consulting fee of directly from FreedomWorks and from allied astroturf front groups FreedomWorks paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants The rumour If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen Just days after Obama s inauguration Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour Palin s motives for quitting became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue signed on as a regular contributor to Fox News and received million an episode for a reality show on cable television Sarah Palin s Alaska Palin s book tour which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus resembled both a presidential campaign and a travelling carnival Whether or not Palin intends to run for president her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the Republican Party Yet the ever expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos desperately seeking to expand the party s base after the drubbing in Steve Schmidt formerly McCain s campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of warned that Palin s nomination in would be catastrophic for the GOP His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in revealing her as one of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over Unfortunately for Schmidt and other party pragmatists those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party its most fervent activists and cannot be dissuaded from following her even if she is leading the party off a cliff A special congressional election in New York s heavily Republican rd district in was the first major test of Palin s power Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman an unknown far right third party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party in the process helping to force a popular moderate Republican politician Dede Scozzafava from the race In the end Palin s ideological purge in upstate New York led to an improbable Democratic victory the first in that district in more than years After the disaster Palin and her allies claimed victory insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party She went on to endorse Rand the son of right wing libertarian Ron and a candidate in Kentucky s GOP senatorial primary meanwhile W Bush s vice president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand s regular Republican opponent Trey Grayson the Kentucky secretary of state The self described hardcore pro lifer Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement s ranks recasting herself accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of economic freedom She claimed the Democratic cap and trade plan to limit carbon emissions would harm the livelihood of blue collar workers and she assailed healthcare reform as a Trojan horse for socialism though she admitted her family used to hustle over the border to take advantage of Canada s single payer healthcare system But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for death panels that would recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome afflicted son Trig With the click of a button Palin transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous The source of Palin s death panels smear was a practiced propagandist former New York s lieutenant governor McCaughey When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president McCaughey falsely claimed in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy the government s programme the article widely circulated by Republicans would go on to win a National Magazine Award only to be retracted years later by the New Republic s editors Now she was back in the spotlight pushing a rumour that would be voted by the non partisan fact checking website Politifact com as the lie of McCaughey s latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche which mobilised to push the rumour the mainstream In one of LaRouche s top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel the National Institute of Health s chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler s T programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in that began the genocide there LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin charged Soon LaRouche s followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a Hitler moustache At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank a Democratic a LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama as Hitler posters and demanded Why do you continue to support a Nazi policy as Obama has expressly supported this policy Two months later after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook prominent conservatives from former House speaker Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance committee member Charles Grassley parroted her claims before audiences of indignant Tea Paters Not to be outdone Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death panels Beck echoing the LaRouche cultists accused Ezekiel Emanuel of the devaluing of human life putting a price on each individual He thundered The death panel is not a firing squad Rationing is inevitable and they know it The death panel rumour served a variety of functions all useful to the movement but not necessarily to the Republican Party Most importantly the rumour resonated both with hard core libertarians who resented the very existence of the federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery slope to government sponsored euthanasia The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in when the evangelical conservative Dobson publicly clashed with Armey the libertarian leader over the right of the government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death The enemy The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper agent crypto Muslim helped bring the neo conservatives back the fray The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney s daughter Liz who founded an anti Obama advocacy group Keep America Safe by leveraging donations from pro Israel sources Asked by CNN s Larry King about the Birther movement that was challenging Obama s status as an American citizen Liz Cheney remarked One of the reasons you see people so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever I think a president who seems so reluctant to defend the nation overseas With the libertarians Christian right and the neocons seated around the same table united in resentment of the alien president the conservative movement was whole again The experiments in terror management theory developed by three professors of psychology Sheldon Solomon of Skidmore College Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado have demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes The findings help explain the effectiveness of the death panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists Indeed these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical reasoning calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality Whether or not independent voters responded the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage ensuring a standing army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance Obama s first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests there were several disturbing murders committed by far right extremists In a year old neo Nazi wannabe named Poplawsi mowed down a Swat team of Pittsburgh cops killing three Poplawski s best friend told reporters the young killer grew angry recently over fears Obama would outlaw guns Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video clip to a neo Nazi website portraying Fox s Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration camps After a characteristically thorough investigation Beck conceded they were not real On another occasion the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party rallies A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath Scott Roeder a supporter of the militant anti abortion group Operation Rescue shot Dr Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita Kansas Tiller was declared fair game by the anti abortion movement because of his role as Kansas s only late term abortion provider During at least twenty eight episodes of Bill O Reilly s O Reilly Factor O Reilly had referred to Tiller as Tiller the baby killer a criminal guilty of Nazi stuff I wouldn t want to be Tiller if there is a Judgment Day O Reilly proclaimed In a middle aged professional named Sodini walked a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and gunned down three women The major media outlets explained Sodini s motives away by homing in on passages in his online diaries describing his loneliness inability to convince women to have sex with him and descent chronic masturbation Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual frustration onto Obama whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation The day after Obama s election victory Sodini wrote Good luck to Obama He will be successful The liberal media LOVES him Amerika has chosen The Black Man Good In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama s plans for the economy and such Here it is Every black man should get a young white girl Kinda a reverse indentured servitude thing Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college she be real good I saw it Not my little girl daddy says Yeah right Black dudes have thier sic choice of best white ellipses in original In another posting to an anti Clinton forum in during the height of the Republicans Whitewater investigation Sodini revealed that he had purchased a bumper sticker reading Stop Socialism Impeach Clinton from a National Review ad A year later Sodini ranted on an anti government militia site I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring the country back to the Constitutional order that it was years ago I don t think any group of political leaders will achieve this for us Whether or not Sodini s murder spree was motivated by his political passions he was pathologically death driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right wing imagery In his final diary entry Sodini proclaimed Death lives The bible More than any other media figure of the Obama era Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party Patriots During a broadcast of Fox and Friends Beck opined that Obama has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep seated hatred for white people or the white culture As evidence Beck pointed to White House green jobs czar Van an African American former community organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck s crusade From there Beck targeted another black Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and as evidence of Obama s socialist agenda In another broadcast Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African Americans referring to Obama money as they collected welfare cheques in Detroit Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City based youth group practicing a step show a traditional African American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that Obama s SS was being trained across inner city America In Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn the rights new favourite hobgoblin admitting that he intended to use the poor people s advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate Trust me Beck said Everybody now says they re going to be talking about healthcare I don t think so His statement was reminiscent of Rush Limbaugh s scandal mongering remark during the early Clinton administration Whitewater is about healthcare Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden camera videos shot by conservative youth activists O Keefe and Hannah Giles inside Acorn field offices In the videos O Keefe baited African American staffers making statements explaining that Giles who claimed she was a prostitute could obtain low income housing O Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn however Giles later admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn In the end Acorn was exonerated of all criminal wrongdoing In a separate incident O Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone lines in the office of Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana Like Ryan Sorba O Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well funded conservative outfits O Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute the right wing youth group that nurtured leading lights like Jack Abramoff Karl Rove Ralph Reed and Jeff Gannon While O Keefe and his buddies plea bargained with prosecutors Beck basked in his formula for success His show earned the highest ratings at Fox News topping network franchises like O Reilly and Sean Hannity In the process Beck s opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists Glenn Beck has taught us everything we know a demonstrator at the rally told me He s opened our eyes to so much But unlike the right wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich s Republican counter revolution of Beck was not an authentic product of the movement When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves Beck was mired in the world of mid level commercial radio delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in hopes of becoming the next Howard By night as he has tirelessly recounted he medicated his anxiety with cocaine and alcohol destroying his first marriage in the process We remember Glenn from the womanising the drinking the drugs Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was a shock jock from Tampa Florida who called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show Like Dusty Rhodes the pseudo populist demagogue of Elia Kazan s film A Face in the Crowd Beck was a self destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog in an alleyway or been locked away in a prison cell had fame not found him first Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from freedom marrying a conservative Mormon converting to her religion and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs conservative radio diatribes When Beck first broke television on CNN s Headline News Channel he struggled to articulate a coherent political worldview If he distinguished himself from other big time conservative hosts in any way he did so through strained and often snide attempts at humour remnants of his failed radio career Nevertheless with help from his liberal agent Matthew Hiltzik Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early Around this same time Beck began promoting the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy peddler named W Cleon Skousen whom he described as his political lodestar Suddenly Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures Thanks to Beck s designation of Skousen s pseudo historical tract The Year Leap as required reading on the website of his Project and his promotion of the book on his show the previously obscure Skousen became the Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement By summer Skousen s Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in to selling over copies in Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand It is little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified to explain why America is the greatest nation in history In the process Skousen claims that church and state separation is un American that coercive taxation is communist and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society Benjamin Franklin who wrote at length on the merits of amours with old women and who famously solicited prostitutes and fathered a son of out of wedlock was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world s foremost source of eternal wisdom he buttressed his points with fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd s screeds about the Illuminati According to Skousen Dodd claimed that powerful influences congregating in the United States like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United States the first world war Skousen published Dodd s manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen s Digest which he founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies Skousen s paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti communist groups during the s He boasted of a close friendship with then FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist plots claims disputed by FBI historians During a recent interview Skousen s son told me that contrary to rumours of Hoover s cross dressing and homosexual dalliances he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City s police chief for in the words of the city s conservative Mormon mayor conduct ing his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government From there Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist and earning condemnation from his beloved FBI which accused him in an internal memo of promoting his own anti communism for obvious financial purposes Skousen s vocal support for the far right Birch Society s claim that communists controlled President Dwight Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red bashing lecture tours He went off the radar for several years returning during the late s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil rights movement By the late s even the Church of Latter Day Saints distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared entirely had Beck not revived it turning The Year Leap the bible of the Tea Party movement Alexander Zaitchik observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen s renewed influence through Beck and the Tea Party suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place The descent Besides influencing Beck Skousen s teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement s most visible grassroots celebrities retired sheriff Mack I met Mack in at a far right rally just outside of Montgomery Alabama On a makeshift stage towed the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck Mack recalled with reverence his mentorship by Skousen who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution Mack urged his spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food If you control the food supply Mack warned you control the people And that s the first step to slavery Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal background checks of gun purchasers Mack reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government Along with a few dozen former and active military and law enforcement personnel Mack helped form a self styled Tea Party militia called the Oathkeepers Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans concentration camps Because the group s members trained for combat the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance Besides Mack the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia movement retreads its ranks The most well established figure was Mike Vanderboegh a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid s entitled Strategy and Tactics fora Militia Civil War calling for sniper attacks on war criminals secret policemen rats With Obama in office Vandeboegh churned out anti government screeds on right wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by cashing in the in federal disability compensation he received each month For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama s agenda it was a Democrat who posed the greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since placing him among the senior leadership of the so called centrist Blue Dog Democrats When healthcare reform was introduced in Congress Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti abortion Democrats making him the de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill By extension Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low income women But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops Stupak went a step further He introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance plans The amendment which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate became a key sticking point in healthcare negotiations He s a big hero now in the pro life community Deal Hudson former Catholic issues adviser to W Bush told me in Thanks to him this is the first time I can remember the pro life Democrats having any power To the chagrin of the Republicans Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership According to Hudson the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass but only if the bill contained a clear provision forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion Finally in after pressure from Nancy Pelosi Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion Stupak had been mollified Now he and his anti abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill As soon as reports seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform major right wing blogs like RedState org churned out virulent denunciations of Stupak calling him a traitor and sellout The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr Tiller Bart the Baby Killer On thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol s Longworth Building in expectation of Obama s pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote Democratic a hero of the civil rights movement and Barney Frank the first openly gay member of Congress passed through the crowd on their way inside the Capitol Nigger a demonstrator barked at Another called Frank a faggot eliciting laughter and cheers from nearby protesters Meanwhile as another African American Democrat Emanuel Cleaver ascended the Capitol steps a protester who had been screaming at and Frank spat on his face With the demonstration carried on the night cries of Kill the bill drifted calls for violence I would gladly stand with any of you men here and take these fascists down a man in camouflage battle dress uniform proclaimed in front of an amateur videographer pointing toward the Capitol You haven t heard the last of me The next day Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters The demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside Finally after hours of impassioned speeches on the House floor the bill passed But the drama was hardly over Republican Joe Pitts an anti abortion Catholic who co authored Stupak s original amendment demanded a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail In response Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans The motion to commit does not support life Stupak declared It is the Democrats who have stood up Heckling from the Republican side interrupted his statement As Stupak looked around the House chamber Randy Neugebauer a right wing Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement began shouting at him from the backbench Baby killer Other Republicans joined in parroting base insults While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a right wing Kristallnacht If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear break their windows Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far right blog hours after the bill passed Break them NOW Break them and run to break again Within three days windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York Kansas and Arizona had been shattered Meanwhile at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats Images of nooses were faxed to the offices of Stupak and Clyburn an African American congressman from South Carolina Anthony Weiner an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform received a menacing letter filled with white powder The brother of Tom Perriello another healthcare supporter had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online he had meant to post the congressman s and encouraged activists to drop by to express their anger about Perriello s recent vote In Tucson Arizona the windows of Democratic Gabrielle Giffords office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun And a brick was thrown through the window of Louise s office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper attacks After the passage of the healthcare bill the Tea Party floated a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy Crusading to restore a holy social order they promoted disorder Claiming to protect democracy they smashed windows of elected representatives Warning of death panels they called in death threats With the atmosphere of violence thickening Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle cry Don t Retreat Instead RELOAD Thus concluded the first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship

4562,Statement on Aung San Suu Kyi,Madame Secretary passing along a statement on Aung San Suu Kyi for your review Thanks Dan STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON Release of Aung San Suu Kyl Today I join with billions of people around the world to welcome the long overdue release of Burmese democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest Aung San Suu Kyi has endured enormous personal sacrifice in her peaceful struggle to bring democracy and human rights to Burma including unjustified detention for most of the past twenty years The Burmese regime has repeatedly rejected her offers to engage in dialogue and work together trying instead to silence and isolate her Through it all Aung San Suu Kyi s commitment to the Burmese people has not wavered The United States calls on Burma s leaders to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyi s release is unconditional so that she may travel associate with her fellow citizens express her views and participate in political activities without restriction They should also immediately and unconditionally release all of Burma s political prisoners We urge Burma s leaders to break from their repressive policies and begin an inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratic and ethnic leaders towards national reconciliation and a more peaceful prosperous and democratic future

4801,for your mom,Keith Richards Has Memories to Burn By JANET MASLIN It is p m Eastern Daylight Time in the New York office of Keith Richards s manager a place that might look ordinary if every wall and shelf were not crammed with some of the world s most glorious rock n roll memorabilia Mr Richards has a o clock appointment Come on in he ll be here in a minute an assistant says and here he comes in a minute at This from a man who once prided himself for operating on Keith Time as in the security staff ate the shepherd s pie that Keith wanted in his dressing room Then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait The Rolling Stones don t play until another shepherd s pie shows up Chalk up the promptness to the man s new incarnation he is now Keith Richards distinguished author True he is far from the only rock star to turn memoirist and far from the only Rolling Stone to write a book about himself very much about himself The raven haired Ron Wood wrote Ronnie in which he described Brian as me in a blond wig Bill Wyman the band s retired bass player and bean counter wrote Stone Alone in which not a shilling demo disc went unmentioned Now Mr Richards has written the keeper Life a big fierce game changing account of the Stones nearly half century long adventure It s the most difficult thing I ve ever done he says about the book I d rather make ro records But he sounds anything but weary And he seems refreshed bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered kohl eyed pirate Keith Richards who looks like miles of bad road Today in neutral street clothes and hot green shoes he is positively debonair On his hands the ubiquitous silver skull ring swollen knuckles the thin white scar from a hunk of steaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through a concert without stopping On his head both a headband and a raffish straw colored hat gray tufts poking out in all directions Not a single gewgaw hangs off it I ve been through that phase he says Don t know that the hair will take the pressure anymore He s been through quite a lot of phases And they re all on the page in Life the Boy Scout really the tyro rocker the lovestruck kid mad for Ronnie Spector unbeknownst to Phil Spector the astonished new star the heroin addicted older one the jaded veteran of countless world tours and the longtime sparring partner of Mick Jagger Despite tabloid shock over the bickering in the book these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early os All of this is recounted with straight up candor and some of it is easily sensationalized But the book s single biggest stunner is a hand written note on its jacket flap Believe it or not I haven t forgotten any of it How he is asked is this humanly possible from a man as well known for stupefaction as Satisfaction I think my main concern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable he says Fox had to do a little sleuthing Fox is Fox the journalist and author of White Mischief who has been Mr Richards s friend over many years and was his collaborator in putting Life together It was sold to Little Brown Company for a reported advance of more than million Mr Fox wound up researching Mr Richards s past conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawing upon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries Spent day practising the year old Mr Richards wrote in when the Stones were just beginning to play in public Worthwhile I hope Also exhumed a letter from Mr Richards to his Aunt Patty describing a boy he had known in primary school Mick Jagger He signs off Luff Keith XXXXX These artifacts turned out to be the Richards equivalent of Proust s madeleines though Mr Richards whose reading taste runs to naval history and the novels of Patrick O Brian and MacDonald Fraser would hardly put it that way In any case they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover and Life began to click Once his stories were told and a draft was written he and Mr Fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as Mr Fox read B the whole book aloud What I couldn t guess was that he d be such a very good natural editor Mr Fox reached by e mail says of Mr Richards He cut accordingly for pace and rhythm a real musical cut As for calling the book Life Mr Richards did some editing there too My Life was what the book was to be called I said I tell you what just cut off the My and you ve got a title he says He might just as appropriately have used another title he likes Keep It Dark But he says I m saving it for a song The contents of Life are dark enough already The book begins with a drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was persuaded to free Mr Richards after confiscating his hunting knife which still hangs in the courtroom and having a picture taken with him How did Mr Richards get so lucky I really can t explain it he says deadpan about that now Maybe I ve got an honest face It covers many other arrests too as well as Mr Richards s grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction which he claims to have done successfully years ago Stories like this aren t told very much he insists There aren t many people willing to tell them Then there are the other health hazards that the book describes Like electrocution My most spectacular one was in Sacramento he now says with a smile drifting off a fond sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching an ungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth He has a good laugh at the memory of finding himself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say Well they either wake up or they don t Life has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard sounding anatomical swipe at Mr Jagger But this is a book that pulls no punches and most of its disses are more serious than that Cold blooded and vicious are only two of the more printable words he uses to describe Brian Allen Ginsberg was an old gasbag Mick Taylor the former Rolling Stone didn t do anything after he left the band and Donald Cammell the film director Performance starring Mr Jagger and Anita Pallenberg Mr Richards s longtime lover and partner in crime couldn t commit suicide quickly enough to suit Mr Richards He shot himself in When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms Pallenberg Mr Richards remembers replying with this Later pal As for Mr Jagger the complaints are deep seated They involve credit hogging social climbing egomania insecurity unethical business behavior and here comes a Freudian s holiday for anyone who s ever watched the bare chested young Jagger and Richards vamp it up together uncertain sexual identity There s also a cool condescension about Mr Jagger s contributions to the duo s songwriting And a nasty nickname or two like Disco Boy In conversation about all this Mr Richards is emphatically blase It s bound to be somewhat rough but the point is I m trying to tell the story from Day to now he says And sure There s the odd conflict here and there But if you weigh it all out those things count for nothing Mr Richards did see to it that Mr Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of time The important thing to me he says was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what And is there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point No But is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway As Life emphatically demonstrates the answer is yes And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr Richards jokingly calls Keefs Guitar Workshop Here are the secrets of some of the world s most famous rock riffs and the almost toy level equipment on which they were recorded like the cassette recorder onto which Mr Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for Street Fighting Man Jumpin Jack Flash and part of Gimme Shelter Here s how the silent beats in Elvis Presley s Heartbreak Hotel worked their way some of Mr Richards s most inspired solos Mr Fox found that Heartbreak Hotel itself was the key to some of Mr Richards s best musical memories Some of this is by now well known to music critics But Mr Richards makes it fascinating at the layman s level And he is surprised to find that early readers haven t been skipping the musicology even though the book cordially invites them to do so What he finds most gratifying about having written Life is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the breadth and range of this book s material He is the rare memoirist who can say without hyperbole that what I hoped was worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine It s getting late Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr Richards s name is emblazoned on a director s chair where assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere where there s a discreet little skull in the middle of the wall mirror where his Louis Vuitton guitar case he did an ad for Vuitton is parked in a corner But the items likeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder a lighter more cigarettes in a pack Do you mind if I smoke he had asked when he first appeared Easy one Who aside from Keith Richards and certain legal authorities has ever kept Keith Richards from doing anything But an hour has gone by and he hasn t touched the cigarettes He hasn t even looked at them He has done not one thing to make him resemble the sullen haunted diabolically beautiful creature on the cover of his book the one with hellfire blazing up from his hand to meet the blurry white thing he s smoking That he says innocently when asked about the picture Oh that s just me lighting a cigarette That s all I was doing
4802,H: Predictable Woodward outcome. Sid,aned by Woodward s Fire by Leslie H Gelb I pm The president and his team cooperated with the famed author s new book Leslie H Gelb on the fallout and how Obama s Wars shows the U S is stuck in an open ended conflict Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward Mr First Draft of History repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the closed doors of President Obama s most intimate advisers They all knew what was happening The president s men were helping The Washington Post s sleuth write the inside story of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of Herculean labors the war in Afghanistan There s only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets many of his subordinates feel liberated to tell their side of the story By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials well no one looks terribly heroic Let s start with Obama who emerges from the pages of Obama s Wars as he is brilliant emotionless abstract focused and confused a Chicago law school professor in presidents clothes He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a brilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery but that he trudged on doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances The worst circumstance as Team Obama alleged to Woodward was that the Pentagon leadership and the U S generals did not give him the real choices he was asking for He wanted options for troop increases below even far below what the generals were giving him He didn t get them He wanted a strategy for how U S forces would be drawn down after they reached their projected peak of about more than three times the number W Bush left him The military didn t provide him with that either As they say in Missouri Give me a break If the commander in chief of the United States doesn t know how to get what he wants from the U S military he might want to do something about that And some of the many generals in the White House who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task To cut to the chase Obama didn t understand what he had to do tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president s wishes or they will be fired Republican presidents do just that And so as Woodward describes Obama had to write the strategy all by himself This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources One is that the president has just not been clear enough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to pursue wars Woodward has this right Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem The president told Woodward that he didn t think about the Afghan war in the classic terms of the U S winning or losing I think about it more in terms of Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at the end What on earth does that mean Or try this one to Sen Lindsey Graham R SC about whether the deadline to begin withdrawal was firm I have to say that I can t let this be a war without end and I can t lose the whole Democratic Party Does that mean Obama really believes in the war but his party doesn t Or to White House aides This needs to be a plan about how we re going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan So if he wanted such a plan he should have gotten such a plan He is president after all Which leads to the second problem When a president is not clear about a tough problem the military smells vacillations And they sure don t like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war Americans don t fathom well the military mentality The military in most countries throughout history doesn t like to go to war they like to build up their arms and overall strength But once in war they want only more troops fewer restrictions on their use and above all victory victory victory Since Vietnam they smell only vacillation among Democrats and they don t like it For their part Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them and they don t care for the suits either It s not a happy circumstance Woodward didn t explore this underlying reality which is critical for Americans to understand breakAd The White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen Stanley McChrystal s firing over naughty things said about the White House to a reporter According to a preliminary Army investigation the general and perhaps even his senior Army aides were not the sources of those nasty quotes It was some other guys you know the usual culprits the Navy and civilians There will be further formal inquiries on this but nothing good will come of them There s another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that I believe he gets more wrong than right That is Woodward s repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room the inner sanctum for White House meetings over Afghan policy Mr Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all My information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy Based on my sources there is no doubt that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Defense Secretary Bob Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost always quite cordial and in full lock step They along with the NSC Adviser Jim and field commanders like General McChrystal and General Petraeus are the key players Of course Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading The generals did lobby for their positions in public in advance of presidential decisions And that s a big no no But by that standard almost all Obama s top advisers did as much The day after his West Point speech last where he set the firm date of to begin unspecified U S troop withdrawals almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn t have to take this date too seriously that everything was conditions based That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton So if anything most of Obama s top counselors were more or less united sometimes against where he seemed to be going Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals and it s a stunner You have to recognize also that I don t think you win this war I think you keep fighting It s a little bit like Iraq actually Yes there has been enormous progress in Iraq But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq and you have to stay vigilant You have to stay after it This is the kind of fight we re in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids lives The brilliant general said as much to others over the last year It s enough to knock your socks off So far there are no heroes to this narrative only self described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever Doubtless President Obama does not want to fight an open ended war He s sworn to that time and again and I believe him despite his history of calling for victory and defeat of the Taliban and al Qaeda But what the Woodward book demonstrates is that Obama and his team just don t know how to get from here to there So far there are no heroes to this narrative only self described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever Leslie H Gelb a former New York Times columnist and senior government official is author of Power Rules How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy HarperCollins a book that shows how to think about and use power in the st century He is president

4855,more...,Ed Miliband s victory was carried by an anti undercurrent In the first round voting was ahead But when the votes of Ed Balls was distributed to the second choice of voters they put Ed over Balls represents but even more a distancing from New Labour Ed s use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of the repudiation of New Labour Ed had more labor union votes for leader which accounted for one third of total Ed s new generation rhetoric covers that regression and continuing reactive impulse Now the shadow cabinet due to a new decision will be elected by the party Ed is the former environment minister and good on green issues of course but has no foreign policy perspective yet instinctively to the left which means anti Afghanistan mission as currently conceived it should go without saying lost precisely because he held responsible positions Sid

5114,Marc Grossman Article you requested,Diplomacy Before and After Conflict By Marc Grossman Conflict is a universal condition older than diplomacy While conflict is a constant in human history the nature of armed conflict and especially the nature of st century warfare has been transformed General Rupert identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force The ends for which we fight are changing we fight amongst the people our conflicts tend to be timeless we fight so as not to lose the force on each occasion new uses are found for old weapons the sides are mostly non state The nature of st century diplomacy is also changing To be successful diplomats must simultaneously shape act upon and react to global challenges As Hans Binnendijk and Kugler of the National Defense University argue no single problem danger or threat holds the key to the world s future What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our responses The definition of victory too is different today Twenty first century national security success will encompass a comprehensive definition of security and will be achieved by the broadest simultaneous application of all elements of national power This is the key to understanding Bobbitt s concept of preclusive victory which he describes as anticipatory precautionary attention to possible futures requiring an expansive and integrated approach to modern diplomacy defense and development A diplomatic strategy designed to produce preclusive victory will include conflict prevention successful negotiation deterrence the preparation for conflict should all else fail and efforts to establish order ensure stability and promote political and economic pluralism after conflict Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and its aftermath The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State Department from to as the Department s Executive Secretary and U S Ambassador to Turkey Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as Assistant Secretary of State for European and as Under Secretary of State for Political from to I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy the methods and goals needed to prevent conflict diplomacy s role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable and the contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners we can now make better use of the methods and theory of conflict prevention The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a leadership role in these efforts Lund a practitionerscholar notes that the present uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted international conflict prevention regime or system of governance that is of agreed upon arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated functional responsibilities are assigned norms and procedures are formulated and actors are held accountable for their responsibilities He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to coordinate and rationalize a system of preventive diplomacy where should responsibility for the tasks of preventive action be located early warning the decision to act the formulation of a response or the provision of bureaucratic and political support Should it be horizontal across different organizations or actors or should it be vertical up or down their chains of command An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund s tests was the effort undertaken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO in close collaboration with the European Union EU and the Organisation for Security and Co operation in Europe and supported by the United States to avoid civil war in Macedonia in It is difficult now to recall that until the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international headline This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson and the EU High for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and a former NATO Secretary General Javier Solana I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson Solana and Ambassador Pardew whom President W Bush and Secretary appointed as the U S representative to the effort and who along with Francois Leotard the EU Envoy played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement As a direct participant senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort including the need for personal and institutional teamwork the importance of early engagement in trying to head off violence the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind including st century diplomats who can act unconventionally and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate force quickly Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict the role of the diplomat changes The new requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and imperative The diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet France were designed to show the world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic s attacks in Kosovo I was in Rambouillet as Assistant Secretary of State for European to support Secretary Madeleine After the first day or so of the meeting there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary to depart Rambouillet and leave the negotiating to those of us more junior My strategy was that by not being present the Secretary of State and the administration could keep a distance from an outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States The Secretary had a different vision hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars but she was also prepared for the meeting to fail and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be exhausted Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically including her continued presence so that if Rambouillet was a failure there could be no further excuses against taking military action Secretary of State Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in Baker relates in his memoirs The Politics of Diplomacy that President H W Bush had concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to to show America s commitment to avoiding war if possible Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits it would give the administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war it would shore up domestic support for conflict and it would show that as the deadline for Iraq s withdrawal from Kuwait neared the administration was doing something other than just preparing for war The President s offer turned the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on As Baker recounts I was under no illusions I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of days we would be at war In the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a menace but in a box posing no immediate direct threat to the United States focus should be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government Iraq had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning of the administration and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for smart United Nations UN sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability which is a consciousness of what the other side will accept Kissinger did not consider this trait a particular positive at the time and the department s culture of negotiability did not serve as a good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq If that was so during the period surrounding s d tente with Russia diplomatic efforts with the of Iran and the crisis in the Middle East and the resulting war this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath assuming or hoping that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring of The State Department s Director of Policy Planning Haass observed that while he was against going to war no organization could function if people left every time they lost out on a decision Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction if he had known they did not he says he would have been against the war And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest The department sought instead to try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President H W Bush and argued that the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force in the region in early If this failed there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create a broad coalition to move militarily later in This possibility of a broad international coalition lost all relevance on when the French government announced that it would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in Iraq Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated one job of diplomats is to support military commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible with the fewest casualties for Americans allies and civilians This was the objective that the United States pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War which resulted in President Turgut Ozal s support of American efforts The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the whole of the U S Government and the governments of the NATO Allies To pursue a successful bombing campaign diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and support for Allied forces A similar effort by U S diplomats took place before the invasion of Afghanistan in American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding Afghanistan including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first time in order to achieve transit overflight and bed down rights for American and coalition forces before the beginning of action in Afghanistan Before the invasion of Iraq in and especially after a similar effort began in earnest Diplomats supported U S Central Command commander General Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit American allied and Iraqi civilian casualties American diplomats worked with military commanders to seek access to facilities for U S forces and to participate in the public diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq American diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to convince the Turks to allow the th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern front in the battle against Saddam s forces Although the State Department worried about the size of the Department of Defense DOD request to Ankara it worked closely with both civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint DOD State diplomacy however could not overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament which reflected strong public opposition to the war The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force Military force may restore security but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict As Rupert writes We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a resolution of the matter directly by force of arms since at all but the most basic tactical level our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their territory or forces argues that the civil military structure designed to make political military decisions is deeply problematic and distorts decisionmaking in many ways In his book imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office FCO and Ministry of Defense MOD officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of FCO What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda MOD What do you want us to do FCO We ought to act Something must be done We can t have people being massacred As a permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing MOD So you want us to use military force FCO Yes MOD To do what To stop the killing FCO Yes Exactly MOD Who do you want us to fight We are not clear who is doing the killing is it tribe on tribe or is it a force found from a tribe And Rwanda is a big country Where do we start Kigali presumably it s the capital and we would want an airhead FCO Well there must be an international force of course MOD And what would be the British aim in joining the force FCO To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council MOD Is Britain to lead the force FCO No it should be led by the UN a proper UN mission MOD That will take some time to assemble so it will probably be too late to stop the killing FCO Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order MOD OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available Given our deployments in Ireland Bosnia and a few other places not many FCO What do you suggest MOD What are our government s priorities Is contributing to this force a higher priority than these other tasks we are already undertaking FCO Probably not MOD In that case these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support And if we want to speed up the deployment of this force offering a logistic unit would probably be the most valuable contribution FCO Will that put our soldiers at risk MOD Hardly any Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation having participated in something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall In the American debate the issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills It is worth stating at least in the American case that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State Department s inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces in an increasing number of situations that were important but not vital to U S national interests While this readiness to volunteer U S military forces to solve problems around the world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required it leads to understandable consternation among those in uniform Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict There are many issues defeating extremism promoting pluralism bringing the benefits of globalization to those who have not yet benefited living sustainably on the planet nonproliferation that will be part of any definition of successful st century diplomacy But getting postconflict diplomacy right creating the conditions for a preclusive victory may be the most crucial of all This is not an easy assignment The concept of success can be redefined after the fact further complicating the assessment Successful democratic governance and economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date and therefore the need for time and patience is a necessity on the ground However patience is limited in home countries and fatigue often sets in Thus the potential for failure is high Industrial war produced winners and losers today s lines are not so clearly drawn and the timeline may be longer Rupert again brings clarity to this assessment We intervene in or even decide to escalate to a conflict in order to establish a condition in which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways We seek to create a conceptual space for diplomacy economic incentives political pressure and other measures to create a desired political outcome of stability and if possible democracy if a decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war establishing a condition may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people s point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a military operation carried out following s rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to create the conditions identifies as objectives Schnaubelt has noted that a typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries areas of responsibility and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic foot of airspace There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general Nothing comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks which tend to be assigned by function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career at the State Department In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in almost Kurds fled to the mountains between Iraq and Turkey Stranded in harsh conditions they began to starve by the thousands each day I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey Inspired by the leadership of Ambassador Morton Abramowitz American diplomats followed by American military forces and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations initiated Operation Provide Comfort which became Operation Northern Watch This was not just a whole of government but a whole of theinternational community campaign to provide humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq Once home they needed to be protected and for years the United Sates and some of its allies including Turkey worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this area from Saddam by enforcing a no fly zone These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans As recounts some of the pre Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey As one of s successors as Assistant Secretary for European I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Gelbard and Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole of government efforts in postconflict post Yugoslavia I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of State for Political promoting reconciliation development political progress and nationbuilding in Kosovo Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti East Timor and Liberia called upon the resources of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for development and sustained peace The U S effort in Colombia too highlighted the need to focus on an integrated and cross sectoral approach which included disarmament demobilization and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict society But the main events in modern diplomacy s postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and Iraq The key to understanding U S diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the profound disagreement inside the U S Government especially between DOD and State about whether the United States should engage in nationbuilding a policy President Bush had campaigned against in State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping supporting the deployment of U S military forces to participate for example in the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor Haiti and the Balkans Most believed that nationbuilding properly funded and executed was an effective long term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of classical diplomacy carried out in the st century context Secretary directed Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in to create a new Afghan government To succeed Dobbins worked with all the key players including representatives from Iran to support a major role for the United Nations and put Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan But as Dobbins has written the Bush Administration having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits Public security throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans despite the fact that Afghanistan had no army and no police force The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of U S or international assistance to Afghanistan Washington accepted the diffusion of responsibility there with the British taking charge of counternarcotics the Italians reforming the justice sector and the Germans training police This satisfied the need for burden sharing but did not lead to success In addition postconflict resources focused by the United States on Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations even including Kosovo American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council led planning for postconflict Iraq Much of the planning was detailed but focused on lessons learned from the first Gulf War The department s Future of Iraq Project while important would not have solved Iraq s postwar problems State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the immediate postconflict administration of Iraq and its leadership agreed to the Executive order creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq although Dobbins s argument that looking back the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances is worth noting On the State Department did officially open on time and on budget an Embassy in which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more comprehensive senior civilian military cooperation There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts the need to have adequate civilian capacity to respond including a role for a revitalized U S Agency for International Development USAID As this journal chronicled in an article by Ambassador Herbst the Secretary of State s Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization S CRS his office was mandated to develop a whole ofgovernment civilian response to stability operations and to ensure civilian military coordination The Civilian Response Corps CRC is in an early stage and ultimately will be made up of a reserve component in addition to the existing active and standby components The personnel are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts engineers lawyers judges corrections officials diplomats development experts public administrators public health officials city planners border control officials economists and others Currently the active and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State USAID and a core group of domestic U S Agencies Once congressionally funded the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments and the private sector Between and CRC members deployed to countries including Afghanistan for planning purposes and there are realistic plans to have active members and standby members ready to deploy by the end of There are now at least other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding capacity some including stability or civilian police and employing wholeof government or comprehensive approaches similar to that created by Washington Several in fact have higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America s One way for State to further support the S CRS effort would be to consider creating a new personnel specialty the expeditionary diplomat Washington s diplomatic personnel have of course always been in one sense expeditionary the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed abroad the majority of the time But the post diplomatic experience and especially the effort in Iraq and Afghanistan means that State needs to be more explicit about the expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment s notice Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan the lessons learned with S CRS and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking The first requirement would be advanced training some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central Intelligence Agency for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special career path These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places just as we now ask diplomats who take the hardest languages Chinese or Arabic for example to serve more than one tour using their skills Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military the State Department could allow people to opt in and out of this special force during their careers as long as they have the proper training This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well The department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded The creation of S CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive simultaneous diplomacy needed for the future and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID commitment to the civilian response capacity There are still key questions to be answered about civilian capacity In the face of a real world situation will DOD really support a State Department led operation Will Congress adequately fund S CRS including a reasonable contingency fund How will S CRS and a resurgent USAID work together Where will the lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding There seems to be no question that the path is the right one consistent with the administration s focus on diplomacy development and defense Success will come with clear direction and active implementation If we combine the observations made by several authors we arrive at this question What national policies supported by adequate human and financial resources will create the conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory Nation building post conflict reconstruction and stability operations and counterinsurgency strategy call it what we will will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come Accomplishing this task does not have to be an exclusively American responsibility and indeed one of the goals of modern American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international But for the foreseeable future the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from Germany to Iraq These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the elements of power and influence together in the same theater at the same time and in close coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed As Bobbitt has written The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling This picture unfolds in this way peace making by diplomats war making by the Armed Forces peace building by US AID and reconstruction personnel The reality of st century warfare however is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously While the challenges and opportunities of the st century can be observed and analyzed individually none of them can be solved without reference to the others Diplomacy is not the answer to every question but it has utility both before and after conflict As General writes at the end of his volume For the general purpose of all interventions is clear we seek to establish in the minds of the people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of action when in confrontation over some matter or another This applies as much to the state possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them rogue or otherwise as it does to the terrorist or the machete wielding rebel each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a condition in which to achieve its political goal To do this military force is a valid option a lever of intervention and influence as much as economic political and diplomatic levers but to be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one goal The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear Twenty first century diplomacy working to prevent conflict trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable or dealing with the consequences can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded carried out by well trained dedicated people focused on clear goals set by national leaders and backed by effective military force This is the diplomacy of the future The author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to consider these issues and to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Harvard F Kennedy School Project on Diplomacy for supporting the effort The author also gratefully acknowledges the important contributions of Toni Getze Jill O Donnell and Bliss in making this article a reality References

5146,Martin Indyk sent this to Jeff -- very interesting analysis,probably passed this on to you but just in case I think it s definitely worth reading A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with the Middle East follow From Martin The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that Netanyahu is in a strong position politically with an unusually stable ruling coalition Nobody I spoke with believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its expiry as a gesture to U S peacemaking efforts In their view he could have easily garnered the support of a large majority of the people for whom the settlers are a marginal concern And this would have given him leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet As Dan Meridor noted Likud voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking percent support the two state solution vs only percent of the leadership Lieberman not the Likud is Bibi s chief concern He wants to keep him in the government for as long as possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right including from the Likud who oppose peacemaking For the time being Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to keep Lieberman in the tent But the clock is ticking According to Tzipi Livni she can bring her party the government now and is willing to do so without any demand for rotation provided Bibi is serious about negotiating peace But as the elections grow closer more and more of her party members are turning against the idea of joining the government They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows Kadima with seats up from now Likud slightly down at and Labor at only Therefore if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen he will need to do so sooner rather than later The longer he waits the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to oppose him in the next elections In this context Bibi s negotiating tactics become self defeating Believing that he is a great negotiator and that he is operating in the Middle East bazaar he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the belief that this is the best way to secure the highest price The process of bringing him down to a reasonable price uses up a lot of energy uses up a lot of goodwill humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner and raises doubts about his seriousness In the end under great pressure from all quarters he will make the final concession but only after wasting a lot of time making everybody furious with him and thereby securing no credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners At heart he seems to lack a generosity of spirit This combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a freier sucker in front of his people to create a real problem in the negotiations especially because he holds most of the cards This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of creative ideas Thinking out of the box as he likes to do will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well defined To attempt to broaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct negotiations provide the opportunity to build trust The reason for dwelling on Bibi s psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of making a deal the Israeli public is ready to get on with it if Israel doesn t make a serious move it will further delegitimize its standing internationally something Bibi is deeply concerned about Bibi needs President Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling relations with the U S and if he doesn t make the deal with Abu Mazen now he will have helped to advance the future he is most concerned about a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky unusual for him he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent terror because they believe they are building their state If that proves to be an illusion the motivation will disappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank He considers it quite possible that if Bibi doesn t quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen he will resign because his honor has now been seriously damaged He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns but that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too What is to be done I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you And please forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know Put your arm around Bibi he still thinks we are out to bring him down There is no substitute for working with him even though he makes it such a frustrating process But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge him forward not to buy his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own purposes The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel s security from the vote at the IAEA to the sanctions on Iran to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted Bibi s security requirements That should buy you credibility with him As his friend paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics particularly in terms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about Abu Mazen s politics If all else fails avoid recriminations in favor of a clarifying moment The world will of course blame Bibi But you should avoid any kind of finger pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated solution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen when they re ready The Israeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and they should be allowed to draw their own conclusions Bibi Abu Mazen and the Arab states need negotiations and time is not on the side of any of them They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as we keep the door open From my staffer AM Anne Marie Director of Policy Planning U S Department of State

5200,FW: Politico piece on FA article,Pinstripes to cargo pants Clinton tailors new vision for diplomacy By Elise Labatt CNN p m EDT STORY HIGHLIGHTS It is the first ever undertaking for the State Department Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian power Going forward diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit Washington CNN Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U S diplomacy and development ahead of a top down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks In an essay in the issue of Foreign Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review commonly referred to as the QDDR The review the first ever such an undertaking for the State Department is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their strategy and priorities The new approach to development Clinton says will focus on American leadership through civilian power Both Clinton and Secretary of Defense Gates and have talked about demilitarizing foreign policy and Clinton says the QDDR will suggest how to do that with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis In the article Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document which she called a blueprint for reforms to be implemented over the next four years Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U S government agencies creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that development undertaken by the U S has a lasting and sustainable impact Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the world will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States national security strategy Clinton wrote in Foreign She said that the U S ultimate goal in development was to put itself out of business by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in at the United Nations General Assembly when he released the U S Development Policy which changes U S efforts to focus on building up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy practice Officials say the page document will detail everything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy how the United States undertakes stabilization efforts in post conflict areas how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the types and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach American diplomats going forward Clinton said are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit

5301,H: Les Gelb makes the points. Sid,H Les Gelb who oversaw the writing of the Pentagon Papers makes the points that Wikileaks show US today trying to solve difficult international problems telling the truth and diplomats acting professionally Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U S by Leslie H Gelb I pm Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept cable leaks to smear the U S as evil and selfish Leslie H Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish stupid and wicked but their revelations proved just the opposite When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press you clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world yet lacking the power to dictate solutions U S policymakers and diplomats are shown quite accurately doing what they are supposed to do ferreting out critical information from foreign leaders searching for paths to common action and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on allies and adversaries And in most cases the villain is not Washington but foreign leaders escaping common action with cowardice and hypocrisy Don t think for a New York minute that Julian Assange the Wikileaker unloaded this trove to save humankind Why did he toss in those cables about Italy s leader being a rake and Germany s chancellor being a cautious fuddy duddy and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being paranoid To save the world Not a chance He did it to get attention and he got attention from a drooling press which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial Did Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran Not by the hair on your chinny chin chin He did it to show that he could do it and for the attention Anyone who is not a hopeless left wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time to come Just think if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else and your confidant went out and told others would you soon repeat that mistake Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel When you actually read the cables here s what you see American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world In explaining his deed publicly Assange suggests that what he s doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies His aim he says is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really doing Assange also insists he did this for transparency s sake Yet when he got to look inside he didn t see what was plain that our diplomats were doing a good job Indeed when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers when you actually read the cables here s what you see American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers when you actually read the cables here s what you see American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems Washington needs China s help in bolstering sanctions against Iran and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and gas flow from that country The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China If the world wants to slow or even prevent Iran s march to nuclear weaponry this is a key path to doing so The U S discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran through China The Obama team discovers this informs Beijing and asks Beijing to stop the transfer Beijing declines Really creepy Yemen s leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen He wants to diminish the power of these terrorists as do Americans and most others in the world The lie by the Yemeni president is a harmless way to get a critical job done that is the job of fighting international terrorism Wikileaks tears away the political cover of Yemen s leaders No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China So U S diplomats are searching desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean Peninsula So the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight Chinese thinking about North Korean craziness They won t do that again soon Time and again as one actually reads these cables one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of U S diplomats What are they doing They are not lying and U S leaders are not lying They are actually believe it or not trying to solve problems That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you in these materials So the na ve say it s good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats Give me a break Ask any American diplomat to choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war None of this is to say that there should not be leaks or that the press should not pursue classified information that is necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy If a U S administration is lying or distorting the facts or telling one story to the public and another to itself then by all means let s have it out in public If the U S government is concocting intelligence in order to justify wars let s hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others information they need for serious policy discussion This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U S government to preserve confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most a crime Leslie H Gelb a former New York Times columnist and senior government official is author of

5306,FW: The Republican case for ratifying New START,Here is the Republican former Secretaries of State op ed which ran in today s wash post The Republican case for ratifying New START bn www washingtonpost com wp dyn content article AR html hpid topnews By Henry A Kissinger P Shultz A Baker III Lawrence S Eagleburger and L Republican presidents have long led the crucial fight to protect the United States against nuclear dangers That is why Presidents Nixon Ronald Reagan and H W Bush negotiated the SALT I START I and START II agreements It is why President W Bush negotiated the Moscow Treaty All four recognized that reducing the number of nuclear arms in an open verifiable manner would reduce the risk of nuclear catastrophe and increase the stability of America s relationship with the Soviet Union and later the Russian Federation The world is safer today because of the decades long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons As a result we urge the Senate to ratify the New START treaty signed by President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that expired almost a year ago It reduces the number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while enabling the United States to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those forces as we see fit Along with our obligation to protect the homeland the United States has responsibilities to allies around the world The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the warheads allowed under this treaty are sufficient for all our missions and seven former nuclear commanders agree The defense secretary the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency all originally appointed by a Republican president argue that New START is essential for our national defense We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a Senate ratification vote That is a matter for the administration and Senate leaders The most important thing is to have bipartisan support for the treaty as previous nuclear arms treaties did Although each of us had initial questions about New START administration officials have provided reasonable answers We believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should support ratification First the agreement emphasizes verification providing a valuable window Russia s nuclear arsenal Since the original START expired last Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes in its strategic nuclear arsenal and the United States has been unable to conduct on site inspections Each day America s understanding of Russia s arsenal has been degraded and resources have been diverted from national security tasks to try to fill the gaps Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight Russia s activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent mission Second New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses The testimonies of our military commanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit U S missile defense plans Although the treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine based ballistic missiles our military leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective than building new ones for defense purposes Finally the Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining our nuclear arsenal Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification process The administration has put forth a year plan to spend billion on the Energy Department s nuclear weapons complex Much of the credit for getting the administration to add billion to the originally proposed billion for modernization goes to Sen Jon Kyl the Arizona Republican who has been vigilant in this effort Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond Although the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force the chief nuclear danger today comes not from Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall the hands of terrorists Given those pressing dangers some question why an arms control treaty with Russia matters It matters because it is in both parties interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear relationship It also matters because Russia s cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs Russian help will be needed to continue our work to secure loose nukes in Russia and elsewhere And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in Afghanistan a breeding ground for international terrorism Obviously the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends Any treaty must be considered on its merits But we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest and we should consider the ramifications of not ratifying it Whenever New START is brought up for debate we encourage all senators to focus on national security There are plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the American economy With our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing federal debt bomb we anticipate significant conflict between Democrats and Republicans It is however in the national interest to ratify New START The writers were secretaries of state for the past five Republican presidents Unsubscribe The White House Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington DC

5361,"FW: Rice: New Start: Ratify, With Caveats",OPINION DECEMBER New Start Ratify With Caveats The treaty helpfully reinstates on site verification of Russian nuclear forces but senators should make it clear to Moscow that they don t see it as limiting U S missile defenses By CONDOLEEZZA RICE When U S President Bush and Russian President Putin signed the Moscow Treaty in they addressed the nuclear threat by reducing offensive weapons as their predecessors had But the Moscow Treaty was different It came in the wake of America s withdrawal from the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty of and for the first time the United States and Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment of a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO The real threat was that the world s most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the world s most dangerous regimes or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than And since those very rogue states also pursued ballistic missiles defenses would alongside offensive weapons be integral to the security of the United States and our allies It is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U S national security The treaty is modest reducing offensive nuclear weapons to on each side more than enough for deterrence While the treaty puts limits on launchers U S military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain a triad of bombers submarine based delivery vehicles and land based delivery vehicles Moreover the treaty helpfully reinstates on site verification of Russian nuclear forces which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty last year Meaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and H W Bush and its reinstatement is crucial Still there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and if the treaty is ratified in future monitoring of the Obama administration s commitments First smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent Sen Jon Kyl of Arizona has led a valiant effort in this regard Thanks to his efforts roughly billion is being allocated to the Department of Energy s nuclear weapons complex Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments and Congress should fully fund the president s program Congress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defense strategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley Second the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty the U S is not re establishing the Cold War link between offensive forces and missile defenses New Start s preamble is worrying in this regard as it recognizes the interrelationship of the two Administration officials have testified that there is no link and that the treaty will not limit U S missile defenses But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this Moscow contends that only current U S missile defense plans are acceptable under the treaty But the U S must remain fully free to explore and then deploy the best defenses not just those imagined today That includes pursuing both potential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases I have personally witnessed Moscow s tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment The Russians need to understand that the U S will use the full range of American technology and talent to improve our ability to intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by our missile defenses In addition the welcome agreements on missile defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently between NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field After all a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States but to international stability broadly Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscow s cooperation on other issues The men in the Kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists some who operate in Russia s unstable south are dangerous That alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat from tactical nuclear weapons which are smaller and more dispersed and therefore harder to monitor and control Russia knows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Korea s arsenal is not in its interest Russia lives in those neighborhoods That helps explain Moscow s toughening stance toward Tehran and its longstanding concern about Pyongyang The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in America s future security Nuclear weapons will be with us for a long time After this treaty our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferators not on further reductions in the U S and Russian strategic arsenals which are really no threat to each other or to international stability A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U S nuclear security and that of our allies going forward With the right commitments and understandings ratification of the New Start treaty can contribute to this goal If the Senate enters those commitments and understandings the record of ratification New Start deserves bipartisan support whether in the lame duck session or next year Ms a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a senior fellow at Stanford s Hoover Institution was U S national security adviser from to and U S secretary of state from to

5384,excerpts,http www nybooks com articles archives dec bitter new washington The New York Review of Books In the Bitter New Washington izaibeth O w Of course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people not just talked at them and as Walter Mondale said recently he should have gotten rid of those idiot boards the TelePrompters on which the great orator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences Last year a friend of mine was invited to a Hanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews a group with whom there had been tensions and after the Obamas descended the grand stairway they stood in the foyer briefly the President made a few remarks and shook a few hands and back up the stairs they went No mingling In their first two years the Obamas have seemed a bit tone deaf there were too many vacations while people were hurting especially Michelle s extravagant trip to Spain I m as interested in Michelle s clothes as the next woman but at the same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing which she does Her wardrobe seems quite extensive for these troubled times Barack Obama s personality has been much mulled over in the past two years but it seems inescapable that his high self esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance which trickles down with some exceptions to much of his staff some of whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group and three of the four members of his immediate circle Jarrett Gibbs had had no experience in governing The fourth Rahm Emanuel expressed himself with such flippancy arrogance and overuse of the F word that he offended not just members of Congress but also would be allies of the President Vice President Joe Bider who is liked on Capitol was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the first two years I can handle them Obama told Biden but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the White House s new determination to reach out A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they would reach out but that seemed to last for just a few days One of the oddest aspects of Obama s persona is that someone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be comfortable For example Torn his recently appointed national security adviser a promotion from his role as deputy is by all accounts a capable man but is no one s idea of a serious strategic thinker The explanation I was given for s being given his new position was that the President is comfortable with him Just as Obama is described as pleased with himself he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff After all he had taken on the formidable Clintons and against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts he had beaten them Why should he listen to those who had doubted him A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there were no grown ups around people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in that person was rejected as not one of ours Joe Biden is said to argue with Obama on issues such as Afghanistan but not to get the management of the White House Those who supported Obama in expected him to be able to move public opinion to get people to follow him The fact that the Obama White House has been so poor at messaging baffles even his strongest supporters In fact he had no overall message As Winston Churchill put it there was no theme to his pudding When I asked a White House aide about this he pointed to what had been billed as a major speech on the economy at Georgetown University in But the speech was utterly forgettable and forgotten One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both Obama and his top staff An ally says You can t leave a message if you don t have a strategy and you don t know where you re going Another says They had something that worked in the campaign but didn t work in the White House Thus Obama didn t see the need to explain what he was doing His campaign themes seemed to wander all over the place Stanley Greenberg a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton said that Obama s oft used theme that we shouldn t go back to the Bush days actually tested negatively because people didn t believe that the country was making economic progress So Obama s biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be The jubilation that surrounded his swearing in may have gone to his head while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who were not overjoyed at the advent of a black president or even a Democrat Obama was apparently in his own estimation so smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain and explain again to the country what he was doing and to take the country along with him This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the campaign More than once people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to defend or explain his agenda In a backyard gathering on he made the most awkward reply of those I heard Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn t always think about making sure we got the advertising properly about what was going on Advertising When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was generally supportive of Obama this ordinarily polite man responded Bullocks What policies The risk averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care with strong participation by White House aides But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic press conference on the day after the election In these comments Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn t really understand the role of the president as leader A friend of the Obama administration said to me Their definition of governing is passing bills Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so criticized for being arrogant and aloof he had to eat large portions of humble pie And I take responsibility for that Obama said again and again

5419,H: Jamie Rubin finally lands. Sid,The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg s online and print media properties including Bloomberg Businessweek Bloomberg and the nearly financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and businesses around the world It will be run by two distinguished voices P Rubin a former assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton and Shipley editor of The New York Times Op Ed page got loomberg to Publish Editorials By IERE EviY PE TEP S Being mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone But apparently not for R The mayor s company loomber L P said on that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media enterprise in an effort to broaden the company s influence on national affairs And though Mr Bloomberg has an agreement with the city to have no involvement in the day to day operations of his company the endeavor called Bloomberg View is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview I think it s very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be for sure consistent with the values and beliefs of the founder even if he happens to be mayor of New York City said Matthew Winkler the editor in chief of Bloomberg News I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values In fact I want people to come away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values The effort presents a host of conflict of interest questions for the mayor The new venture provides the mayor with yet another potent communications apparatus one that carries his name and imprimatur to sound off on issues that collide with his job as mayor his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire Bloomberg L P executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr Bloomberg has a direct interest as mayor like education public health and environmental policy Mr Winkler said the editorials would not avoid such issues but would disclose the mayor s involvement when warranted Though Mr Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials he is likely to offer feedback from time to time before they are published Mr Winkler said I think that there s a very good chance that s going to happen he said referring to Mr Bloomberg s occasional involvement It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at arm s length from the company A spokesman for the mayor Stu Loeser said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded he said As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation acquiring the platform of an editorial page is certain to draw more attention to Mr Bloomberg s plans On Mr Bloomberg ruled out a run for president The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg s online and print media properties including Bloomberg Businessweek Bloomberg com and the nearly financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and businesses around the world It will be run by two distinguished voices P Rubin a former assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton and Shipley editor of The New York Times Op Ed page Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg with its just the facts approach In fact the mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in the blogosphere But company leaders including Mr Bloomberg who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two years ago saw an opportunity to extend their influence For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world starting an editorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old one in American journalism Randolph Hearst for example often wrote front page editorials for his newspapers Mr Bloomberg it would seem is casting himself in that mold though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed editorials For now he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him He s accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul said Nasaw a professor of history at the City University of New York Graduate Center who wrote a biography of Hearst This is what we all do We try to persuade the rest of the world we are right Of course we don t have the vehicles to do so The rich have the vehicles to do so Mr Winkler said There s a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L P and Bloomberg News to seize the day literally seize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold And one can t always do that with the best result with reporting That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company the man But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg the company that it should take advantage of Mr Winkler added Bloomberg L P acquired BusinessWeek last year giving the year old company a print product with a long legacy of accomplishment Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington With a service called

5420,FW: The Envoy,THE NBC YORKER The Envoy Posted by Hendrik Hertzberg Last night as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party a friend approached cell phone in hand A few minutes earlier she and I had been inside chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of a holiday party Now she had tears in her eyes died she said Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on critical condition damaged aorta emergency surgery this sudden awful ending was a shock because was such an astounding volcano of vitality Everything about him was large his physical size including the ultimate in your face face a face like a Times Square billboard his buzz saw voice a highly expressive instrument equally adept at piano a side of the mouth gossipy wisecrack often pleasingly nasty and forte a high decibel outburst of anger or indignation almost always calculated for effect his appetites for experience for danger for praise for power for fun and his ambitions for himself for his beliefs for the United States for the world He was no doe eyed peacenik but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular wars He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality romantic about his own tough guy realism Unlike my tearful informant who had known as a family friend since she was a little girl I was acquainted with him in the casual way of many journalists and editors He was a peer as well as a source a prolific and forceful writer whose favorite venues The New Republic and The New Yorker happened to be the places where I ve spent my working life He was gregarious and fond of big splashy black tie evenings The last time I saw him was six weeks ago on st at the New York Public Library s Literary Lions celebration At the pre dinner reception where he would normally have been on his feet looming large he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife Kati Marton bring the party to him At sixty nine he was tired that much was obvious but he was as sharp and voluble as ever He still had plenty to do Not long after achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the end to the Balkan wars I asked him if he liked Warren Zevon s wonderful song The Envoy He said he d never heard of it The next day I sent him a CD After that he mentioned it every single time I ve seen him up to and including that NYPL gala saying he puts it on loud when he needs a lift And no wonder his life was a drama and he liked it that way If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in then the Envoy almost certainly would have become the Secretary of State and the next decade would have unfolded very differently As it is has left a stronger more positive more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post He certainly did not die of a broken heart Kati Marton saw to that but it was surely the ghastly impossible demands of his last impossible assignment that brought on the rending of his aorta He died for his country as surely as any soldier And his deathbed words may turn out to be the most important he ever spoke Photograph Marco Di Lauro Getty Images Read more http www newyo rker on line b log s hend ri khe rtzberq ho lb rooke htm p ri ntab le true ixzz HjNL kn
