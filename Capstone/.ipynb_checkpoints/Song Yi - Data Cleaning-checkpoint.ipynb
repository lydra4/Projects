       "      <td>The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we exp= ected from the discussion at the FERC meeting. The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s= atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000. The Com= mission notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it= s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf= iguration. The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la= ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they= failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or = what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs. The order s= tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi= ssion organizations reflecting natural markets. The Commission indicates t= hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West. Therefore the order requir= es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss= ions as set out in the mediation order. Note that these meetings will star= t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ. The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac= teristics of Order No. 2000. The order finds that Southern's approach to f= ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate. The order = states, \"We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the= Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.\" = The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b= e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo= pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal= e electricity prices. The order therefore directs the parties to the media= tion as stated above. The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta= rting on next Tuesday. It is a lengthier order with more details on other = aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm= ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM. Therefore, I am= attaching a summary of the order. One of the important findings of the or= der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar= e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board. The= refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi= le a compliance filing within 90 days. If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.</td>\n",

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. University of California, California State University and Enron Reach Settlement Agreement ATTENTION: State, Business editors OAKLAND, Calif., July 11 (AScribe News) -- The University of California, California State University and Enron Energy Services announced today a settlement agreement that will extend their contract for two years and return the two university systems to direct access service from Enron. As part of the agreement, UC and the CSU will drop their lawsuit against Enron and Enron will dismiss its appeal. The two university systems had brought suit in federal court seeking to retain their status as direct access Enron customers after Enron had resourced their power procurement to the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&amp;Electric utility companies. \"We are delighted that our negotiations with Enron have ended with retention of the two university systems as direct access Enron customers,\" said Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance. \"The California State University is pleased that we have been able to resolve our differences with Enron and retain our direct access status,\" said Richard P. West, CSU executive vice chancellor and chief financial officer. \"This agreement means considerable savings for the universities and allows us to continue with our energy conservation efforts.\" \"Enron has always been a strong advocate of the benefits of direct access, and we are pleased to be able to extend our contract for two years with UC/CSU,\" said Marty Sunde, vice chairman, Enron Energy Services. \"Separately, with the potential elimination of direct access for California customers, Enron is once again directly serving its commercial customers in California, including UC and CSU. As more and more customers in California see the importance of managing their price risk in power markets, commercial energy users have increased interest in our product offerings.\" The current four-year contract with Enron is scheduled to end on March 31, 2002. The two-year extension, approved in principle, would continue the two university systems as direct access Enron customers until March 31, 2004. Enron and the universities will negotiate price and other terms of the extension between now and Dec. 1, 2001. Both parties have the right to terminate the extension if an agreement is not reached by Dec. 1. The agreement covers all UC campuses and the UC Office of the President, with the exception of UCLA and UC Riverside, which have agreements with their local municipalities. All CSU campuses, except Los Angeles, Northridge, Sacramento and Stanislaus, are part of the Enron contract, as is the CSU Office of the Chancellor. Together, UC and CSU rank as the largest single user of electricity in California. UC's systemwide peak load is 332 megawatts, and CSU's is 117 megawatts. One megawatt powers approximately 1,000 homes. -30- Media Contact: Charles McFadden, University of California, 510-987-9193; charles.mcfadden(at)ucop.edu Colleen Bentley-Adler, California State University, 562-951-4801; Peggy Mahoney, Enron Energy Services, 713-345-7034; pmahoney(at)enron.com AScribe - The Public Interest Newswire / 510-653-9400 $$ APRS0119234206 Copyright ? 2001 Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive LLC.

But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along. The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along. The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to \"give it a chance.\" The Core/Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language. The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.

Real interesting. Worth a look Link to the DWR Contracts. Ban An interesting article too: Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure July 6, 2001 By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday. Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase. The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years. The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time. Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. \"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically,\" said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. \"We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers. The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC). The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC credit. The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of payment or would be permanent. The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&amp;E and SDG&amp;E. The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now have a bill credit receivable. In addition, because EES re-sourced its customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the customer account. The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill credit is to utilize the Utilities' services. Even if EES physically serves the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill credit. The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case. We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow us to be paid if our account became \"inactive\". One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to route the economic value to our DA customers. If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss. Jim</td>\n",

       "      <td>The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the business team on the DA suspension issue. All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision). Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and all DASRs to initiate DA service to the appropriate Utility no later than June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to ensure DA service. New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday). DASRs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001. The July 6 date is our estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts. It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract execution timing. Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the Utility per the tariff process. Once the customer has been returned to Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe. In addition, returning to Utility service may incur a \"re-entry fee\". Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions. These amendments should be signed prior to June 30, 2001. It is possible that the CPUC will require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers. One additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the Negative CTC credit). We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in number to follow). Jim</td>\n",

       "      <td>The train wreck known as California utility crisis continues along. Democrats are turning on one another in the aftermath of the Assembly's failure to pass a SoCal bailout plan. Meanwhile, talk of direct access is threatening to undercut the PUC's ability to hike rates, Davis' plans to issue bonds for a SoCal bailout, and the California state budget. RJ 1. Bryson and Davis Moving To Unseat Burton There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton (D-San Francisco), President Pro Tem. Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low, John Bryson, CEO of SoCal, with the support of the Governor, are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates - Richard Alarcon (D-San Fernando Valley), Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl (D-Los Angeles). Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position. However, at minimum, Bryson, Governor Davis and/or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout. 2. Direct Access Talk a Serious Problem for SoCal and California Budget Additionally, behind the scenes, things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access. \"Direct access,\" or the right of large companies and municipalities to buy power directly in the wholesale market, is fast emerging as a new and serious issue that could make a rescue of SoCal more difficult. It could also complicate existing state plans for the California electricity market and the proposed municipal bond sale, well placed Sacramento sources tell us. The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor's office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance for SoCal. For those interested in more on Direct Access keep reading: Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult, as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long-standing privileges in California politics. Under California law, it is very difficult to stop many cities doing what they please. Most older and larger cities are \"charter cities\" rather than \"general law cities\" subject to the California Municipal code. Under the California Constitution, charter cities can \"pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army,\" says one source. The League of California cities - a weighty organization representing every one of California's cities - is already swinging into action to support direct access. Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councillors and have some sympathy with local independence. And the resistance within the Assembly is already building against Hertzberg's attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access. Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state legislature on the issue. But if municipalities do not opt out, they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company. Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers. Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on the matter, and this could affect campaign contributions. State power plans at risk If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies, it could undermine at least three key elements of the State of California's power plans: ? First, the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users. But municipal power would unpick this structure, allow large regions of California to ignore the PUC, leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city. Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes. Others might cave into irate voters; ? Second, the plans laid out by Governor Davis' and State Treasurer Angelides' for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it. \"It is possible that long-term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long-term rates by buying on the open market,\" one source says. \"It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss;\" ? Third, revenues to back the proposed power bonds could be imperilled, if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond. And if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state, it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments. The issue is at an early stage -- the PUC had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday. So far, the matter has been seen as a micro technical issue rather than as one of the biggest hurdles the state will have to face. State legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession, or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away. But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult</td>\n",

       "      <td>Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker Wednesday night and urged him not to convene an Assembly session during the scheduled recess, since the Senate is not going to interrupt their vacation. Burton's request, in conjunction with the Speaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it themselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edison bailout plan tomorrow. Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burton wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses. Since there is not expected to be any hearing on any bills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on August 20th - we look for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug 15th deadline. State of the Negotiations-- Issues to Be Covered Below are the current provisions Keeley and Hertzberg are wanting to pass into legislation (when they return from recess). Currently, they are not sure if all of these amendments would be wrapped up into one bill or if they would just amend bill SB78XX while introducing a new bill SB_XX. Working under the assumption that they would amend bill 78XX and introduce a new one, the following issues are a reflection of their current positions. If they decide to introduce one new bill than the issues below would be included into one piece of legislation. Please remember, these issues are only their current thoughts and are such to change. There are important differences in the proposals with significant implications for a SoCal voluntary filing--these include whether to include a bond bailout; conservation easement; a rate-payer benefit account; neither bill offers a transmission line purchase or any kind of trust to assist SoCal. SoCal Debt SB _XX No provision for debt. SB 78XX (amended) Approximately $2.9B through corporate bond financing supported by a Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) over a period of time sufficient to pay the bonds (10-15 years). Final debt amount to be established by the PUC and the State Auditor. Core vs. Non-Core SB _XX For purposes of paying the SoCal debt, creates a Core program for consumers with a peak demand of less than ?Kw and Non-Core customers of ?Kw or more. They would share in the cost of SoCal debt retirement: (1) all consumers share pro rata for the first two years, (2) Non-Core pay 100% after two years. SB 78XX(amended) No Provisions. Transmission System Purchase SB _XX and SB 78XX No purchase of transmission assets. Conservation Easements SB _XX No conservation easements. SB 78XX(amended) Specific conservation easements and other land arrangements described in bill for about 24,000 acres per the Governor's MOU. Direct Access SB _XX Removes regulatory constraints on a Direct Access program effective January 1, 2002 and permits customers to buy power if there is a net short after SoCal native generation, bilateral contracts, and DWR contracts. Residential and small commercial customers may use direct access from renewable energy sources. SB 78XX(amended) No provisions for Direct Access. Ratepayer Benefit Account SB _XX Deposits in the account any refunds or net cash resulting from (a) any refunds ordered by FERC or from litigation, and (b) any positive DWR Power Fund revenues; all to be refunded to ratepayers through either bill credits or rate reductions in proportion to the March, 2001 PUC rate increase. SB 78XX(amended) Does not create a Ratepayer Benefit Account. Electric Supplier Claims Settlement Trust SB _XX and SB 78XX Does not create a Trust or trustee to negotiate reductions. Renewable Energy SB _XX Creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to achieve a target of 10% of all new generating capacity additions through 2010 and overall 20% of statewide total generating capacity by 2010. Munis have been exempted from the RPS. SB 78XX(amended) No provisions for renewable energy.</td>\n",

RJ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY California Senate's MOU Debated in State Assembly Coordinating the California Legislature CPUC's Rate Setting Authority In Question Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call MOU As reported earlier, SB 78XX (the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA Senate) has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly. Three important revisions on the bill are: In regard to commercial rates, the assembly has now left open the definition of large or \"industrial users\" by eliminating the previous 500 kWh+ usage requirement. This change could enable the Assembly to categorize either smaller or larger consumers into the industrial/commercial user status The bill would not become effective unless SB 39XX is signed into law. SB 39XX (authored by Sen. Speier) is regarding the CPUC's authority over utilities and generators in California; it places certain generation that was purchased by Reliant, Dynegy, etc. from the utilities after deregulation under PUC authority. The State's purchase of the SoCal Ed. transmission lines has been removed. AB 82XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provisions duplicate in SB 78XX, such as the conservation lands and the option to buy the transmission lines. Additionally, AB 82XX can not be enacted unless SB 1XX (the windfall profits bill) is signed. The joining of 78XX to SB 39XX and of 82XX to 1XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is pressuring the governor to sign these other bills, which otherwise might not have been enrolled. However, the joining of these bills makes their passage more difficult. The remaining provisions of AB 82XX are as follows: Renewables Portfolio Direct Access Ratepayer Refund Account (changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account) Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power DRC replaced with non-bypassable charge option for MOU. This includes reference to balancing account, recovery of reasonable procurement costs, and the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC. Putting the MOU to a Vote The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already, so nothing is really new. Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night (10:00 pm) to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday. It probably has a lot to do with the ability to get enough members' support of these measures and willingness to go back to Sacramento. Many are vacationing; some in other countries. If there is an Assembly session on Friday, he plans to have an informational hearing on the measure today. If the Assembly's session fails to convene Friday, it is unclear what he intends to do. On the other side of the equation, it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back into session to approve this bill. The Senate won't even consider it until it comes back from recess, but the Assembly feels it is their responsibility, thereby putting the onus back on the Senate. Apparently there is really no coordination between the leadership of the different houses. While SB 78XX and AB 82XX are the most publicized bills, neither bill will be the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions. The proposed content of these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the process, thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold numerous hearings. This will speed up the process. Apparently the Speaker's office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used. But they hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the Senate. It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through as two separate bills, though, with the SB 78XX provisions in one bill and the AB 82XX provisions in another. CPUC, Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority Recently, the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUC's rate-setting authority and hand over that power to the California legislature. Politically, this gives the Governor the ability to say, if rates increase automatically, that he did not approve of the rate increase, and there is nothing he can do about it. But it also gives Wall Street buyers of California's revenue bonds assurances that no matter what the need, there will always be enough revenue to back revenue bonds payments; thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for bondholders. Were this provision to pass, the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates for the investor owned utilities. As for DWR, under the draft rate agreement proposed by the CPUC, it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in setting electricity rates that satisfy DWR's \"revenue requirement.\" DWR's revenue requirements include bond-related costs, operating costs (such as power purchase costs), and administrative costs. AB1X provided for energy-related bonds to be sold by the state to support DWR's power purchases. Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it makes bond payments, and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues, the rate-setting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWR's power purchases not just its bond payments. Note that if the Commission adopts a rate agreement, it becomes irrevocable. -The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements. The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWR's requirements in either 30 or 90 days. The 90-day mechanism applies whenever DWR submits a revenue requirement. The 30-day mechanism applies when DWR anticipates or actually draws on its reserves. The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifying how the Commission will set rates to meet DWR's revenue requirements (which includes both bond costs and operating costs). If the CPUC's draft rate agreement is approved, there will be no legislative or PUC oversight of any of those costs, and no opportunity for public comment for as long as bonds are outstanding. If a rate agreement can be avoided, there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreement's demand management and administrative costs. Either way, power contract costs remain an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR and the contractor. SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders of defaulted debt, 24 July 2001, 1:30 PDT: In order for California to sell their revenue-bonds with an investment grade rating, two criterion must be met; 1) there must be a rate-supported, dedicated revenue stream in place and 2) the legislature must have the power to override of the CPUC's rate setting authority and raise rates if necessary. The second criterion, however, faces significant opposition from the California State Constitution. Regarding the DWR rate requirement, Craver, the spokesperson for SoCal, stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers, particularly on the DWR side. He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers, it appears this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure. However, \"we need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be wrong\". Therefore, this is \"risky\" in that SoCal is faced with \"fixed revenues and floating costs.\" Unlike DWR, SoCal has no ability to adjust rates based on costs, making floating natural gas prices a risk. Prudential asked, if based on the Hertzberg legislation, the sale of the transmission assets is now off the table. SoCal responded that this is correct. Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more securitization, i.e., be securitized for all but $500 million with an option to buy the transmission assets at book for 5 years. SoCal responded that it was \"unclear what the pricing [of the transmission assets] would be, but there would be an option\" for the state to purchase the transmission assets. Prudential asked about the status of the remaining (non-legislative) implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation (78XX and 82XX) contains them. SoCal responded that there are 3 outstanding issues remaining for implementing the MOU: 1) Ratemaking for the utilities' retained generation: The PUC is holding hearings on this issue this week. These hearings have slowed the process. A decision is expected by the end of August. 2) A procurement plan for the utility: This plan is before the PUC. SoCal suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before acting on this point. Regardless, the company needs an \"adequate balancing account with an automatic rate trigger.\" 3) Clarification on the utility holding company's position regarding 1st priority: On this front, the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three utilities and their holding companies. The three holding companies have challenged this decision. Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision in favor of the challenge; a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday. This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from the holding companies, but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay the debts of the utilities. Deutsche Bank asked if, in SoCal's numbers reported to date, it was assuming the charges for ancillary services. SoCal responded that DWR had confirmed as of 18 January that it would pick up these charges. These charges would otherwise amount to $800 million - $1 billion in additional revenue requirement for the utility. Based on FERC rulings, SoCal had not been counting on paying these charges, so they are not reflected in the company's numbers. However, SoCal will be paying grid management and uplift charges. They anticipate paying \"some portion\" of these charges. This could potentially require an amended URG filing. Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues. Edison responded that they are \"working on new facilities on the bank side.\" The current facilities expire on October 10th or 11th. Edison indicated it is in the process of finalizing sales of approximately 1,000MW of non-strategic assets. They are in negotiations with the final bidders except for Hopewell, which is done. There is no specific timeline on when the deals will be announced, but it is a matter of days to a week. Appalucia Management asked if, on SoCal's generation, DWR is assuming a cost-plus or retail rate. SoCal responded that it uses cost-of-service based rates. The return on the 12/31/00 rate basis is approximately 4 1/2 cents. The $72.77 stipulated covers SoCal's generation, its contracted generation, QF costs (which were quoted as the most significant portion) and uncollectables. This is driven by gas costs for the QFs. Revenue is fixed at $73.00.</td>\n",

through with what we exp= ected from the discussion at the FERC meeting. The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s= atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000. The Com= mission notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it= s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf= iguration. The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la= ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they= failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or = what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs. The order s= tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi= ssion organizations reflecting natural markets. The Commission indicates t= hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West. Therefore the order requir= es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss= ions as set out in the mediation order. Note that these meetings will star= t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ. The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac= teristics of Order No. 2000. The order finds that Southern's approach to f= ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate. The order = states, \"We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the= Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.\" = The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b= e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo= pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal= e electricity prices. The order therefore directs the parties to the media= tion as stated above. The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta= rting on next Tuesday. It is a lengthier order with more details on other = aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm= ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM. Therefore, I am= attaching a summary of the order. One of the important findings of the or= der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar= e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board. The= refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi= le a compliance filing within 90 days. If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.  \n",

University of California, California State University and Enron Reach Settlement Agreement ATTENTION: State, Business editors OAKLAND, Calif., July 11 (AScribe News) -- The University of California, California State University and Enron Energy Services announced today a settlement agreement that will extend their contract for two years and return the two university systems to direct access service from Enron. As part of the agreement, UC and the CSU will drop their lawsuit against Enron and Enron will dismiss its appeal. The two university systems had brought suit in federal court seeking to retain their status as direct access Enron customers after Enron had resourced their power procurement to the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric utility companies. \"We are delighted that our negotiations with Enron have ended with retention of the two university systems as direct access Enron customers,\" said Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance. \"The California State University is pleased that we have been able to resolve our differences with Enron and retain our direct access status,\" said Richard P. West, CSU executive vice chancellor and chief financial officer. \"This agreement means considerable savings for the universities and allows us to continue with our energy conservation efforts.\" \"Enron has always been a strong advocate of the benefits of direct access, and we are pleased to be able to extend our contract for two years with UC/CSU,\" said Marty Sunde, vice chairman, Enron Energy Services. \"Separately, with the potential elimination of direct access for California customers, Enron is once again directly serving its commercial customers in California, including UC and CSU. As more and more customers in California see the importance of managing their price risk in power markets, commercial energy users have increased interest in our product offerings.\" The current four-year contract with Enron is scheduled to end on March 31, 2002. The two-year extension, approved in principle, would continue the two university systems as direct access Enron customers until March 31, 2004. Enron and the universities will negotiate price and other terms of the extension between now and Dec. 1, 2001. Both parties have the right to terminate the extension if an agreement is not reached by Dec. 1. The agreement covers all UC campuses and the UC Office of the President, with the exception of UCLA and UC Riverside, which have agreements with their local municipalities. All CSU campuses, except Los Angeles, Northridge, Sacramento and Stanislaus, are part of the Enron contract, as is the CSU Office of the Chancellor. Together, UC and CSU rank as the largest single user of electricity in California. UC's systemwide peak load is 332 megawatts, and CSU's is 117 megawatts. One megawatt powers approximately 1,000 homes. -30- Media Contact: Charles McFadden, University of California, 510-987-9193; charles.mcfadden(at)ucop.edu Colleen Bentley-Adler, California State University, 562-951-4801; Peggy Mahoney, Enron Energy Services, 713-345-7034; pmahoney(at)enron.com AScribe - The Public Interest Newswire / 510-653-9400 $$ APRS0119234206 Copyright ? 2001 Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive LLC.

the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along. The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along. The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to \"give it a chance.\" The Core/Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language. The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning. Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday. Best, Jeff  \n",

The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, w= hich are burdened by debt. ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of= the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of t= he day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. Accord= ing to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity = for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to li= ght 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $14= 9.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accura= te. Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a me= gawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloombe= rg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, a= ccording to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on= the day-ahead market. The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-ma= rket purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying str= ategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legis= lators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days aft= er they are signed. =09  \n",

Real interesting. Worth a look Link to the DWR Contracts. Ban An interesting article too: Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure July 6, 2001 By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday. Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase. The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years. The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time. Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. \"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically,\" said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. \"We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex.\"  \n",

Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers. The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC). The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC credit. The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of payment or would be permanent. The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E. The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now have a bill credit receivable. In addition, because EES re-sourced its customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the customer account. The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill credit is to utilize the Utilities' services. Even if EES physically serves the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill credit. The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case. We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow us to be paid if our account became \"inactive\". One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to route the economic value to our DA customers.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision). Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and all DASRs to initiate DA service to the appropriate Utility no later than June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to ensure DA service. New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday). DASRs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001. The July 6 date is our estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts. It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract execution timing. Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the Utility per the tariff process. Once the customer has been returned to Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe. In addition, returning to Utility service may incur a \"re-entry fee\". Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions. These amendments should be signed prior to June 30, 2001. It is possible that the CPUC will require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers. One additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the Negative CTC credit). We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in number to follow). Jim  \n",

Democrats are turning on one another in the aftermath of the Assembly's failure to pass a SoCal bailout plan. Meanwhile, talk of direct access is threatening to undercut the PUC's ability to hike rates, Davis' plans to issue bonds for a SoCal bailout, and the California state budget. RJ 1. Bryson and Davis Moving To Unseat Burton There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton (D-San Francisco), President Pro Tem. Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low, John Bryson, CEO of SoCal, with the support of the Governor, are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates - Richard Alarcon (D-San Fernando Valley), Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl (D-Los Angeles). Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position. However, at minimum, Bryson, Governor Davis and/or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout. 2. Direct Access Talk a Serious Problem for SoCal and California Budget Additionally, behind the scenes, things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access. \"Direct access,\" or the right of large companies and municipalities to buy power directly in the wholesale market, is fast emerging as a new and serious issue that could make a rescue of SoCal more difficult. It could also complicate existing state plans for the California electricity market and the proposed municipal bond sale, well placed Sacramento sources tell us. The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor's office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance for SoCal. For those interested in more on Direct Access keep reading: Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult, as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long-standing privileges in California politics. Under California law, it is very difficult to stop many cities doing what they please. Most older and larger cities are \"charter cities\" rather than \"general law cities\" subject to the California Municipal code. Under the California Constitution, charter cities can \"pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army,\" says one source. The League of California cities - a weighty organization representing every one of California's cities - is already swinging into action to support direct access. Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councillors and have some sympathy with local independence. And the resistance within the Assembly is already building against Hertzberg's attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access. Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state legislature on the issue. But if municipalities do not opt out, they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company. Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers. Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on the matter, and this could affect campaign contributions. State power plans at risk If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies, it could undermine at least three key elements of the State of California's power plans: ? First, the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users. But municipal power would unpick this structure, allow large regions of California to ignore the PUC, leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city. Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes. Others might cave into irate voters; ? Second, the plans laid out by Governor Davis' and State Treasurer Angelides' for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it. \"It is possible that long-term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long-term rates by buying on the open market,\" one source says. \"It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss;\" ? Third, revenues to back the proposed power bonds could be imperilled, if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond. And if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state, it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments. The issue is at an early stage -- the PUC had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday. So far, the matter has been seen as a micro technical issue rather than as one of the biggest hurdles the state will have to face. State legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession, or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away. But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker Wednesday night and urged him not to convene an Assembly session during the scheduled recess, since the Senate is not going to interrupt their vacation. Burton's request, in conjunction with the Speaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it themselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edison bailout plan tomorrow. Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burton wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses. Since there is not expected to be any hearing on any bills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on August 20th - we look for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug 15th deadline. State of the Negotiations-- Issues to Be Covered Below are the current provisions Keeley and Hertzberg are wanting to pass into legislation (when they return from recess). Currently, they are not sure if all of these amendments would be wrapped up into one bill or if they would just amend bill SB78XX while introducing a new bill SB_XX. Working under the assumption that they would amend bill 78XX and introduce a new one, the following issues are a reflection of their current positions. If they decide to introduce one new bill than the issues below would be included into one piece of legislation. Please remember, these issues are only their current thoughts and are such to change. There are important differences in the proposals with significant implications for a SoCal voluntary filing--these include whether to include a bond bailout; conservation easement; a rate-payer benefit account; neither bill offers a transmission line purchase or any kind of trust to assist SoCal. SoCal Debt SB _XX No provision for debt. SB 78XX (amended) Approximately $2.9B through corporate bond financing supported by a Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) over a period of time sufficient to pay the bonds (10-15 years). Final debt amount to be established by the PUC and the State Auditor. Core vs. Non-Core SB _XX For purposes of paying the SoCal debt, creates a Core program for consumers with a peak demand of less than ?Kw and Non-Core customers of ?Kw or more. They would share in the cost of SoCal debt retirement: (1) all consumers share pro rata for the first two years, (2) Non-Core pay 100% after two years. SB 78XX(amended) No Provisions. Transmission System Purchase SB _XX and SB 78XX No purchase of transmission assets. Conservation Easements SB _XX No conservation easements. SB 78XX(amended) Specific conservation easements and other land arrangements described in bill for about 24,000 acres per the Governor's MOU. Direct Access SB _XX Removes regulatory constraints on a Direct Access program effective January 1, 2002 and permits customers to buy power if there is a net short after SoCal native generation, bilateral contracts, and DWR contracts. Residential and small commercial customers may use direct access from renewable energy sources. SB 78XX(amended) No provisions for Direct Access. Ratepayer Benefit Account SB _XX Deposits in the account any refunds or net cash resulting from (a) any refunds ordered by FERC or from litigation, and (b) any positive DWR Power Fund revenues; all to be refunded to ratepayers through either bill credits or rate reductions in proportion to the March, 2001 PUC rate increase. SB 78XX(amended) Does not create a Ratepayer Benefit Account. Electric Supplier Claims Settlement Trust SB _XX and SB 78XX Does not create a Trust or trustee to negotiate reductions. Renewable Energy SB _XX Creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to achieve a target of 10% of all new generating capacity additions through 2010 and overall 20% of statewide total generating capacity by 2010. Munis have been exempted from the RPS. SB 78XX(amended) No provisions for renewable energy.  \n",

RJ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY California Senate's MOU Debated in State Assembly Coordinating the California Legislature CPUC's Rate Setting Authority In Question Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call MOU As reported earlier, SB 78XX (the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA Senate) has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly. Three important revisions on the bill are: In regard to commercial rates, the assembly has now left open the definition of large or \"industrial users\" by eliminating the previous 500 kWh+ usage requirement. This change could enable the Assembly to categorize either smaller or larger consumers into the industrial/commercial user status The bill would not become effective unless SB 39XX is signed into law. SB 39XX (authored by Sen. Speier) is regarding the CPUC's authority over utilities and generators in California; it places certain generation that was purchased by Reliant, Dynegy, etc. from the utilities after deregulation under PUC authority. The State's purchase of the SoCal Ed. transmission lines has been removed. AB 82XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provisions duplicate in SB 78XX, such as the conservation lands and the option to buy the transmission lines. Additionally, AB 82XX can not be enacted unless SB 1XX (the windfall profits bill) is signed. The joining of 78XX to SB 39XX and of 82XX to 1XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is pressuring the governor to sign these other bills, which otherwise might not have been enrolled. However, the joining of these bills makes their passage more difficult. The remaining provisions of AB 82XX are as follows: Renewables Portfolio Direct Access Ratepayer Refund Account (changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account) Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power DRC replaced with non-bypassable charge option for MOU. This includes reference to balancing account, recovery of reasonable procurement costs, and the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC. Putting the MOU to a Vote The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already, so nothing is really new. Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night (10:00 pm) to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday. It probably has a lot to do with the ability to get enough members' support of these measures and willingness to go back to Sacramento. Many are vacationing; some in other countries. If there is an Assembly session on Friday, he plans to have an informational hearing on the measure today. If the Assembly's session fails to convene Friday, it is unclear what he intends to do. On the other side of the equation, it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back into session to approve this bill. The Senate won't even consider it until it comes back from recess, but the Assembly feels it is their responsibility, thereby putting the onus back on the Senate. Apparently there is really no coordination between the leadership of the different houses. While SB 78XX and AB 82XX are the most publicized bills, neither bill will be the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions. The proposed content of these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the process, thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold numerous hearings. This will speed up the process. Apparently the Speaker's office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used. But they hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the Senate. It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through as two separate bills, though, with the SB 78XX provisions in one bill and the AB 82XX provisions in another. CPUC, Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority Recently, the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUC's rate-setting authority and hand over that power to the California legislature. Politically, this gives the Governor the ability to say, if rates increase automatically, that he did not approve of the rate increase, and there is nothing he can do about it. But it also gives Wall Street buyers of California's revenue bonds assurances that no matter what the need, there will always be enough revenue to back revenue bonds payments; thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for bondholders. Were this provision to pass, the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates for the investor owned utilities. As for DWR, under the draft rate agreement proposed by the CPUC, it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in setting electricity rates that satisfy DWR's \"revenue requirement.\" DWR's revenue requirements include bond-related costs, operating costs (such as power purchase costs), and administrative costs. AB1X provided for energy-related bonds to be sold by the state to support DWR's power purchases. Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it makes bond payments, and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues, the rate-setting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWR's power purchases not just its bond payments. Note that if the Commission adopts a rate agreement, it becomes irrevocable. -The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements. The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWR's requirements in either 30 or 90 days. The 90-day mechanism applies whenever DWR submits a revenue requirement. The 30-day mechanism applies when DWR anticipates or actually draws on its reserves. The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifying how the Commission will set rates to meet DWR's revenue requirements (which includes both bond costs and operating costs). If the CPUC's draft rate agreement is approved, there will be no legislative or PUC oversight of any of those costs, and no opportunity for public comment for as long as bonds are outstanding. If a rate agreement can be avoided, there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreement's demand management and administrative costs. Either way, power contract costs remain an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR and the contractor. SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders of defaulted debt, 24 July 2001, 1:30 PDT: In order for California to sell their revenue-bonds with an investment grade rating, two criterion must be met; 1) there must be a rate-supported, dedicated revenue stream in place and 2) the legislature must have the power to override of the CPUC's rate setting authority and raise rates if necessary. The second criterion, however, faces significant opposition from the California State Constitution. Regarding the DWR rate requirement, Craver, the spokesperson for SoCal, stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers, particularly on the DWR side. He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers, it appears this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure. However, \"we need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be wrong\". Therefore, this is \"risky\" in that SoCal is faced with \"fixed revenues and floating costs.\" Unlike DWR, SoCal has no ability to adjust rates based on costs, making floating natural gas prices a risk. Prudential asked, if based on the Hertzberg legislation, the sale of the transmission assets is now off the table. SoCal responded that this is correct. Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more securitization, i.e., be securitized for all but $500 million with an option to buy the transmission assets at book for 5 years. SoCal responded that it was \"unclear what the pricing [of the transmission assets] would be, but there would be an option\" for the state to purchase the transmission assets. Prudential asked about the status of the remaining (non-legislative) implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation (78XX and 82XX) contains them. SoCal responded that there are 3 outstanding issues remaining for implementing the MOU: 1) Ratemaking for the utilities' retained generation: The PUC is holding hearings on this issue this week. These hearings have slowed the process. A decision is expected by the end of August. 2) A procurement plan for the utility: This plan is before the PUC. SoCal suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before acting on this point. Regardless, the company needs an \"adequate balancing account with an automatic rate trigger.\" 3) Clarification on the utility holding company's position regarding 1st priority: On this front, the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three utilities and their holding companies. The three holding companies have challenged this decision. Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision in favor of the challenge; a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday. This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from the holding companies, but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay the debts of the utilities. Deutsche Bank asked if, in SoCal's numbers reported to date, it was assuming the charges for ancillary services. SoCal responded that DWR had confirmed as of 18 January that it would pick up these charges. These charges would otherwise amount to $800 million - $1 billion in additional revenue requirement for the utility. Based on FERC rulings, SoCal had not been counting on paying these charges, so they are not reflected in the company's numbers. However, SoCal will be paying grid management and uplift charges. They anticipate paying \"some portion\" of these charges. This could potentially require an amended URG filing. Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues. Edison responded that they are \"working on new facilities on the bank side.\" The current facilities expire on October 10th or 11th. Edison indicated it is in the process of finalizing sales of approximately 1,000MW of non-strategic assets. They are in negotiations with the final bidders except for Hopewell, which is done. There is no specific timeline on when the deals will be announced, but it is a matter of days to a week. Appalucia Management asked if, on SoCal's generation, DWR is assuming a cost-plus or retail rate. SoCal responded that it uses cost-of-service based rates. The return on the 12/31/00 rate basis is approximately 4 1/2 cents. The $72.77 stipulated covers SoCal's generation, its contracted generation, QF costs (which were quoted as the most significant portion) and uncollectables. This is driven by gas costs for the QFs. Revenue is fixed at $73.00.  "

Meanwhile  talk of direct access is threatening to undercut the PUC s ability to hike rates  Davis  plans to issue bonds for a SoCal bailout  and the California state budget  RJ    Bryson and Davis Moving To Unseat Burton There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton  D San Francisco   President Pro Tem  Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low  John Bryson  CEO of SoCal  with the support of the Governor  are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates   Richard Alarcon  D San Fernando Valley   Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl  D Los Angeles   Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position  However  at minimum  Bryson  Governor Davis and or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout     Direct Access Talk a Serious Problem for SoCal and California Budget Additionally  behind the scenes  things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access   Direct access   or the right of large companies and municipalities to buy power directly in the wholesale market  is fast emerging as a new and serious issue that could make a rescue of SoCal more difficult  It could also complicate existing state plans for the California electricity market and the proposed municipal bond sale  well placed Sacramento sources tell us  The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor s office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance for SoCal  For those interested in more on Direct Access keep reading  Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult  as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long standing privileges in California politics  Under California law  it is very difficult to stop many cities doing what they please  Most older and larger cities are  charter cities  rather than  general law cities  subject to the California Municipal code  Under the California Constitution  charter cities can  pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army   says one source  The League of California cities   a weighty organization representing every one of California s cities   is already swinging into action to support direct access  Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councillors and have some sympathy with local independence  And the resistance within the Assembly is already building against Hertzberg s attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access  Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state legislature on the issue  But if municipalities do not opt out  they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company  Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers  Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on the matter  and this could affect campaign contributions  State power plans at risk If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies  it could undermine at least three key elements of the State of California s power plans    First  the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users  But municipal power would unpick this structure  allow large regions of California to ignore the PUC  leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city  Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes  Others might cave into irate voters    Second  the plans laid out by Governor Davis  and State Treasurer Angelides  for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it   It is possible that long term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long term rates by buying on the open market   one source says   It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss     Third  revenues to back the proposed power bonds could be imperilled  if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond  And if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state  it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments  The issue is at an early stage    the PUC had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday  So far  the matter has been seen as a micro technical issue rather than as one of the biggest hurdles the state will have to face  State legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession  or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away  But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult</td>\n",

s Rate Setting Authority In Question Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call MOU As reported earlier  SB  XX  the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA Senate  has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly  Three important revisions on the bill are  In regard to commercial rates  the assembly has now left open the definition of large or  industrial users  by eliminating the previous   kWh  usage requirement  This change could enable the Assembly to categorize either smaller or larger consumers into the industrial commercial user status The bill would not become effective unless SB  XX is signed into law  SB  XX  authored by Sen  Speier  is regarding the CPUC s authority over utilities and generators in California  it places certain generation that was purchased by Reliant  Dynegy  etc  from the utilities after deregulation under PUC authority  The State s purchase of the SoCal Ed  transmission lines has been removed  AB  XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provisions duplicate in SB  XX  such as the conservation lands and the option to buy the transmission lines  Additionally  AB  XX can not be enacted unless SB  XX  the windfall profits bill  is signed  The joining of  XX to SB  XX and of  XX to  XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is pressuring the governor to sign these other bills  which otherwise might not have been enrolled  However  the joining of these bills makes their passage more difficult  The remaining provisions of AB  XX are as follows  Renewables Portfolio Direct Access Ratepayer Refund Account  changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account  Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power DRC replaced with non bypassable charge option for MOU  This includes reference to balancing account  recovery of reasonable procurement costs  and the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC  Putting the MOU to a Vote The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already  so nothing is really new  Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night      pm  to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday  It probably has a lot to do with the ability to get enough members  support of these measures and willingness to go back to Sacramento  Many are vacationing  some in other countries  If there is an Assembly session on Friday  he plans to have an informational hearing on the measure today  If the Assembly s session fails to convene Friday  it is unclear what he intends to do  On the other side of the equation  it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back into session to approve this bill  The Senate won t even consider it until it comes back from recess  but the Assembly feels it is their responsibility  thereby putting the onus back on the Senate  Apparently there is really no coordination between the leadership of the different houses  While SB  XX and AB  XX are the most publicized bills  neither bill will be the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions  The proposed content of these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the process  thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold numerous hearings  This will speed up the process  Apparently the Speaker s office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used  But they hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the Senate  It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through as two separate bills  though  with the SB  XX provisions in one bill and the AB  XX provisions in another  CPUC  Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority Recently  the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUC s rate setting authority and hand over that power to the California legislature  Politically  this gives the Governor the ability to say  if rates increase automatically  that he did not approve of the rate increase  and there is nothing he can do about it  But it also gives Wall Street buyers of California s revenue bonds assurances that no matter what the need  there will always be enough revenue to back revenue bonds payments  thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for bondholders  Were this provision to pass  the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates for the investor owned utilities  As for DWR  under the draft rate agreement proposed by the CPUC  it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in setting electricity rates that satisfy DWR s  revenue requirement   DWR s revenue requirements include bond related costs  operating costs  such as power purchase costs   and administrative costs  AB X provided for energy related bonds to be sold by the state to support DWR s power purchases  Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it makes bond payments  and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues  the rate setting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWR s power purchases not just its bond payments  Note that if the Commission adopts a rate agreement  it becomes irrevocable   The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements  The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWR s requirements in either   or   days  The   day mechanism applies whenever DWR submits a revenue requirement  The   day mechanism applies when DWR anticipates or actually draws on its reserves  The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifying how the Commission will set rates to meet DWR s revenue requirements  which includes both bond costs and operating costs   If the CPUC s draft rate agreement is approved  there will be no legislative or PUC oversight of any of those costs  and no opportunity for public comment for as long as bonds are outstanding  If a rate agreement can be avoided  there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreement s demand management and administrative costs  Either way  power contract costs remain an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR and the contractor  SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders of defaulted debt    July        PDT  In order for California to sell their revenue bonds with an investment grade rating  two criterion must be met     there must be a rate supported  dedicated revenue stream in place and    the legislature must have the power to override of the CPUC s rate setting authority and raise rates if necessary  The second criterion  however  faces significant opposition from the California State Constitution  Regarding the DWR rate requirement  Craver  the spokesperson for SoCal  stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers  particularly on the DWR side  He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers  it appears this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure  However   we need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be wrong   Therefore  this is  risky  in that SoCal is faced with  fixed revenues and floating costs   Unlike DWR  SoCal has no ability to adjust rates based on costs  making floating natural gas prices a risk  Prudential asked  if based on the Hertzberg legislation  the sale of the transmission assets is now off the table  SoCal responded that this is correct  Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more securitization  i e   be securitized for all but    million with an option to buy the transmission assets at book for   years  SoCal responded that it was  unclear what the pricing  of the transmission assets  would be  but there would be an option  for the state to purchase the transmission assets  Prudential asked about the status of the remaining  non legislative  implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation   XX and  XX  contains them  SoCal responded that there are   outstanding issues remaining for implementing the MOU     Ratemaking for the utilities  retained generation  The PUC is holding hearings on this issue this week  These hearings have slowed the process  A decision is expected by the end of August     A procurement plan for the utility  This plan is before the PUC  SoCal suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before acting on this point  Regardless  the company needs an  adequate balancing account with an automatic rate trigger      Clarification on the utility holding company s position regarding  st priority  On this front  the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three utilities and their holding companies  The three holding companies have challenged this decision  Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision in favor of the challenge  a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday  This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from the holding companies  but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay the debts of the utilities  Deutsche Bank asked if  in SoCal s numbers reported to date  it was assuming the charges for ancillary services  SoCal responded that DWR had confirmed as of   January that it would pick up these charges  These charges would otherwise amount to    million      billion in additional revenue requirement for the utility  Based on FERC rulings  SoCal had not been counting on paying these charges  so they are not reflected in the company s numbers  However  SoCal will be paying grid management and uplift charges  They anticipate paying  some portion  of these charges  This could potentially require an amended URG filing  Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues  Edison responded that they are  working on new facilities on the bank side   The current facilities expire on October  th or  th  Edison indicated it is in the process of finalizing sales of approximately    MW of non strategic assets  They are in negotiations with the final bidders except for Hopewell  which is done  There is no specific timeline on when the deals will be announced  but it is a matter of days to a week  Appalucia Management asked if  on SoCal s generation  DWR is assuming a cost plus or retail rate  SoCal responded that it uses cost of service based rates  The return on the       rate basis is approximately       cents  The      stipulated covers SoCal s generation  its contracted generation  QF costs  which were quoted as the most significant portion  and uncollectables  This is driven by gas costs for the QFs

       "      <td>FYI  Fairly accurate account of the activities in California  Assembly released new version of Hertzberg s bill late last night  Another update to follow shortly  Best  Jeff State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy Assembly plans own version for utility Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay  Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday  July         San Francisco Chronicle URL  Sacramento    The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern California Edison from falling into bankruptcy  but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov  Gray Davis faces an uncertain future  The bill by Democratic Sens  Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of Palo Alto would give the state a five year option to buy the utility s transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than      billion of the utility s debt  Edison amassed an estimated      billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen  The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night  but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to California s botched   deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers  Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before Aug     a date set in the original agreement between Davis and Edison  Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night  but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town   It s a firm deadline  which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess   Davis said of the Aug    date  Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills  but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days   I have problems with both bills   Davis said   I am heartened by the fact that there s a bill moving in each house   Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote  and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process  In the Senate    Democrats voted for the Edison plan  while four Democrats and all   Republicans voted no  Sen  Jackie Speier  D Hillsborough  said she would vote for the bill in its current form  but not if any substantial changes are made   The Legislature is ill equipped to try to craft a deal   she said   This particular measure    and only this one    has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers  I m leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being cannibalized   The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue      billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks  The bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged Edison s largest customers and would not cover the    billion Edison owes out of state generators  Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy  which would put it back in the position of buying power  The state has been spending upward of    million a day on power since January  and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power  There is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas   Electric Co  out of bankruptcy  In the Assembly  two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill  The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley  D Boulder Creek  was undergoing changes to garner more support  Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal  Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist  D San Jose  one of the undecided members on the Edison agreement  said the original bill was too complex   It s a cleaner bill   Alquist said   I think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG E  I would say I m tentatively satisfied   Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the Edison negotiations  Only a few members of the Assembly    all former state senators now in the lower house    voted to approve the   legislation  AB   that brought deregulation to California  Assemblyman Joseph Simitian  D Palo Alto  said he gave a courtesy vote to the Hertzberg Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee  in order to get the measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate   As we ve learned from the experience of AB   the devil is in the details  I have a lot of questions   Simitian said   The difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline  and then once there is a deadline  too much gets done   Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed  but he said lawmakers are well informed about the energy crisis and its details  He said they have had   hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis  A wild card in the Assembly s plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright  D  Los Angeles  that garnered Republican support  The so called  straight bailout  would give Edison its      billion through a    a month fee levied on utility ratepayers  It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee  E

       "      <td>Restructuring Today readers got this story today    Retail market can be opened nationally      Joe Barton thinks it can and is about to try     Once in   years opportunity seen How can the retail power market be opened in today s atmosphere  Joe Barton has a way and it sounds like it just might work  He briefed APPA members winding up the last day of the annual meeting in Washington  Barton implored the membership that if they have any ideas on how to improve energy policy  this is the time to tell policy makers or him  Barton sees a narrow  six week opportunity as America is about to revise its energy policy  We walked with him to his car after the speech and asked what he means by a major energy restructuring bill  He referred vaguely to legislation that would improve the grid and foster the functioning of a robust market providing for movement of power from one place to another  He wants a national market with a grid that can handle it  in an open access way    creating all these trading markets where you have long term and short term markets where you balance supply and demand around the country   States that have surplus power  through the RTO system can wheel that power to states that need it   That s the wholesale market  we asked  Yes  But what about retail  He hopes to get into the law a provision to foster aggregation of buyers  How would that work   AARP   Barton said noticing our age   could sell you power or Wal  Mart or McDonalds or the co ops  You could buy your power through them   How would a law provide for aggregation   It would be in the federal legislation that it would be permitted   he replied  But what about Nebraska where there are only munis   You ve got to work through that and see if you get some kind of grandfather or state opt out provision  It s possible that you give states the right to opt out  But over time those states will want to opt in   he added   That ll be a debate we ll have when we get into the bill  You re not supposed to ask that tough a question this early in the process   he reminded with a smile  Barton is really impressed with the magnitude of the legislation gestating in the nation s capital   Everything  is up for discussion  he said   everything   There is nothing    nothing    that s been debated or talked about in terms of electricity that is not on the table   Barton assured   I m not saying we re going to do it all but you have a window like this once every   to   years  I m going to be damned if I m going to stand around and on my on volition take things off the table   Now the process will automatically take a lot more controversial items out of play  There ll be a region or a political block    who knows the president might not like something  John Dingell might not like something  Who knows  But I m not    even before we put pen to paper to start drafting the bill    say  we re not going to consider this    Barton added  Is he getting signals from Dingell that he might be cooperative   Yeah  Very cooperative  Of course  again  the proof is in the pudding and in the details   Barton s in the leadership role in fostering a national energy policy  taking the package from the vice president and guiding it through the House  He s the president s energy guy from an energy state and Bush has shown    with the tax bill    that he can get a program enacted  Barton wants something he can look back at in five    and   years and say  that s a good bill  It works   Barton wants to make history with the Energy Policy Act of    Barton told APPA he wants this big bill to be  national  long term in its impact and balanced   Balanced means looking at the generation component  transmission and distribution  and in each of those areas    this is just me  I m not speaking for anyone but myself     he wants  to create an environment so we have a maximum  competitive situation that s open and fair to everybody   And we re going to do that and you re going to have a lot of competition  a lot of flexibility with a lot of choice for consumers and a lot of choice for yourself   Barton added  Wait a minute  He s saying competition in transmission and distribution  We really do need to ask him what he has in mind there when the time is right  We can t help but think of competition in selling pipeline capacity in a secondary market  You can do that with electricity capacity to or on a local distribution system in gas  We re thinking aloud here  That s not what Barton said  He wants to minimize the federal role except where you actually have to  That puts Barton  a little at variance with some in the Bush Administration and some in the Congress because in the modern age there s a natural proclivity to centralize and consolidate which in the political arena means let Washington do it   Barton wants to maximize the technology component and will put into the bill a distributed generation component  He s interested in negawatts  fostering cut backs in demand on a national scale   Looking out for your own interest   Barton considers to be  democracy   But from time to time you have to step back and look at the national interest  he advocated   That s my job   Today s crisis mentality helps Congress act boldly  The friendliness to competitive markets in the White House encouraged by the president s pride about the retail bill he got through the Texas Legislature plus today s environment may be ideal for market  minded leaders  You can benefit from Restructuring Today s special  unique focus on the converging energy and communications industries  especially the opening of competitive markets  too  To subscribe simply fax the attached order form to        Don t miss another vital issue  Subscribe

the discussion at the FERC meeting  The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s  atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No     The Com  mission notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it  s neighboring RTO TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf  iguration  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief  indicating only a la  ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope  they  failed to specify any details of the talks  what changes could be made or   what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs  The order s  tates that the Commission favors the development of large  regional transmi  ssion organizations reflecting natural markets  The Commission indicates t  hat they favor four RTOs   NE  SE  MW and West  Therefore the order requir  es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss  ions as set out in the mediation order  Note that these meetings will star  t next Tuesday  July   before a FERC ALJ  The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac  teristics of Order No     The order finds that Southern s approach to f  ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate  The order   states   We reiterate  the Commission s goal is to have a single RTO in the  Southeast  and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible     The Commission recognizes that start up costs in forming a larger RTO may b  e more  but that over the longer term  large RTOs will foster market develo  pment  will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal  e electricity prices  The order therefore directs the parties to the media  tion as stated above  The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta  rting on next Tuesday  It is a lengthier order with more details on other   aspects of RTOs  including Independent Board requirement  congestion managm  ent  interconnection procedures  planning process and CBM  Therefore  I am  attaching a summary of the order  One of the important findings of the or  der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent  the Applicant TOs ar  e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board  The  refore  the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi  le a compliance filing within   days  If anyone wants copies of the orders  let me know   \n",

July    AScribe News     The University of California  California State University and Enron Energy Services announced today a settlement agreement that will extend their contract for two years and return the two university systems to direct access service from Enron  As part of the agreement  UC and the CSU will drop their lawsuit against Enron and Enron will dismiss its appeal  The two university systems had brought suit in federal court seeking to retain their status as direct access Enron customers after Enron had resourced their power procurement to the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric utility companies   We are delighted that our negotiations with Enron have ended with retention of the two university systems as direct access Enron customers   said Joseph P  Mullinix  UC senior vice president for business and finance   The California State University is pleased that we have been able to resolve our differences with Enron and retain our direct access status   said Richard P  West  CSU executive vice chancellor and chief financial officer   This agreement means considerable savings for the universities and allows us to continue with our energy conservation efforts    Enron has always been a strong advocate of the benefits of direct access  and we are pleased to be able to extend our contract for two years with UC CSU   said Marty Sunde  vice chairman  Enron Energy Services   Separately  with the potential elimination of direct access for California customers  Enron is once again directly serving its commercial customers in California  including UC and CSU  As more and more customers in California see the importance of managing their price risk in power markets  commercial energy users have increased interest in our product offerings   The current four year contract with Enron is scheduled to end on March       The two year extension  approved in principle  would continue the two university systems as direct access Enron customers until March       Enron and the universities will negotiate price and other terms of the extension between now and Dec        Both parties have the right to terminate the extension if an agreement is not reached by Dec     The agreement covers all UC campuses and the UC Office of the President  with the exception of UCLA and UC Riverside  which have agreements with their local municipalities  All CSU campuses  except Los Angeles  Northridge  Sacramento and Stanislaus  are part of the Enron contract  as is the CSU Office of the Chancellor  Together  UC and CSU rank as the largest single user of electricity in California  UC s systemwide peak load is   megawatts  and CSU s is   megawatts  One megawatt powers approximately     homes      Media Contact  Charles McFadden

language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de link the bonds from the DWR contracts  But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along  The bill would require a     s vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule  so Republican votes are necessary  The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along  The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core noncore proposal  Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure  but how much longer is uncertain  No sense yet of when hearings on the core noncore proposal   in conference committee or otherwise  will take place  though Burton continues to say that he wants to  give it a chance   The Core Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language  The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today  but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning  Senator Dunn s Investigative Committee Hearing The hearing s been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday  Best  Jeff  \n",

interesting  Worth a look Link to the DWR Contracts  Ban An interesting article too  Connell  Power cost twice Davis  figure July      By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO    The average cost of electricity purchased under    billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov  Gray Davis  administration  state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday  Connell said her staff s analysis put the per megawatt average at     compared with    to    estimated by Davis  Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates  although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase  The controller  who writes the state s checks  said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts  which range from a few months to   years  The administration  noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas  said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time  Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration s numbers   You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages  long range or short range contracts  peak power or nonpeak  and probably either average could be defended mathematically   said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network   We can t tell you whether it s    or      the contracts are very convoluted and complex    \n",

Edison recommendation to suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers  The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit  even though SCE has already paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC   The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC credit  The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of payment or would be permanent  The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG E and SDG E  The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable  EES would now have a bill credit receivable  In addition  because EES re sourced its customers  the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES  not the customer account  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill credit is to utilize the Utilities  services  Even if EES physically serves the customers going forward  it may not be the same account that has the bill credit  The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint  but it is unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case  We are intending to  a  try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision   b  trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us payment  and  c  trying to determine that the Utilities  tariff would allow us to be paid if our account became  inactive   One other option to consider  at least for SCE  would be to contact SCE management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to route the economic value to our DA customers  If anyone has any questions  please call me to discuss  Jim  \n",

                                                         The following points highlight legal regulatory recommendations to the business team on the DA suspension issue  All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June      meeting  and there are sufficient votes for the decision   Existing Contracts   It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and all DASRs to initiate DA service to the appropriate Utility no later than June      for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to ensure DA service  New Contracts   All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the customer no later than June       July      is a Sunday   DASRs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as possible  but in no event later than July       The July   date is our estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts  It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract execution timing  Switching Option   Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the Utility per the tariff process  Once the customer has been returned to Utility service after July       our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe  In addition  returning to Utility service may incur a  re entry fee   Contract Extensions   EES should consider amending all current contracts that terminate after July      with a Evergreen Provision that provides for Index pricing with   day cancellation notice provisions  These amendments should be signed prior to June       It is possible that the CPUC will require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers  One additional thought   EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision  to overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the Negative CTC credit   We intend to set up a call for  pm Houston time today to discuss  call in number to follow   Jim  \n",

                                                                      The train wreck known as California utility crisis continues along  Democrats are turning on one another in the aftermath of the Assembly s failure to pass a SoCal bailout plan  Meanwhile  talk of direct access is threatening to undercut the PUC s ability to hike rates  Davis  plans to issue bonds for a SoCal bailout  and the California state budget  RJ    Bryson and Davis Moving To Unseat Burton There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton  D San Francisco   President Pro Tem  Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low  John Bryson  CEO of SoCal  with the support of the Governor  are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates   Richard Alarcon  D San Fernando Valley   Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl  D Los Angeles   Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position  However  at minimum  Bryson  Governor Davis and or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout     Direct Access Talk a Serious Problem for SoCal and California Budget Additionally  behind the scenes  things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access   Direct access   or the right of large companies and municipalities to buy power directly in the wholesale market  is fast emerging as a new and serious issue that could make a rescue of SoCal more difficult  It could also complicate existing state plans for the California electricity market and the proposed municipal bond sale  well placed Sacramento sources tell us  The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor s office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance for SoCal  For those interested in more on Direct Access keep reading  Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult  as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long standing privileges in California politics  Under California law  it is very difficult to stop many cities doing what they please  Most older and larger cities are  charter cities  rather than  general law cities  subject to the California Municipal code  Under the California Constitution  charter cities can  pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army   says one source  The League of California cities   a weighty organization representing every one of California s cities   is already swinging into action to support direct access  Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councillors and have some sympathy with local independence  And the resistance within the Assembly is already building against Hertzberg s attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access  Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state legislature on the issue  But if municipalities do not opt out  they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company  Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers  Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on the matter  and this could affect campaign contributions  State power plans at risk If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies  it could undermine at least three key elements of the State of California s power plans    First  the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users  But municipal power would unpick this structure  allow large regions of California to ignore the PUC  leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city  Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes  Others might cave into irate voters    Second  the plans laid out by Governor Davis  and State Treasurer Angelides  for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it   It is possible that long term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long term rates by buying on the open market   one source says   It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss     Third  revenues to back the proposed power bonds could be imperilled  if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond  And if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state  it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments  The issue is at an early stage    the PUC had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday  So far  the matter has been seen as a micro technical issue rather than as one of the biggest hurdles the state will have to face  State legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession  or at least smother the issue until the

                                                  Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker Wednesday night and urged him not to convene an Assembly session during the scheduled recess  since the Senate is not going to interrupt their vacation  Burton s request  in conjunction with the Speaker s trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime  he didn t want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European vacations for   hours   and few members were willing to pay for it themselves   means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg s Edison bailout plan tomorrow  Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed  Burton wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses  Since there is not expected to be any hearing on any bills Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on August  th   we look for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU s Aug  th deadline  State of the Negotiations   Issues to Be Covered Below are the current provisions Keeley and Hertzberg are wanting to pass into legislation  when they return from recess   Currently  they are not sure if all of these amendments would be wrapped up into one bill or if they would just amend bill SB XX while introducing a new bill SB XX  Working under the assumption that they would amend bill  XX and introduce a new one  the following issues are a reflection of their current positions  If they decide to introduce one new bill than the issues below would be included into one piece of legislation  Please remember  these issues are only their current thoughts and are such to change  There are important differences in the proposals with significant implications for a SoCal voluntary filing  these include whether to include a bond bailout  conservation easement  a rate payer benefit account  neither bill offers a transmission line purchase or any kind of trust to assist SoCal  SoCal Debt SB  XX No provision for debt  SB  XX  amended  Approximately     B through corporate bond financing supported by a Dedicated Rate Component  DRC  over a period of time sufficient to pay the bonds      years   Final debt amount to be established by the PUC and the State Auditor  Core vs  Non Core SB  XX For purposes of paying the SoCal debt  creates a Core program for consumers with a peak demand of less than  Kw and Non Core customers of  Kw or more  They would share in the cost of SoCal debt retirement      all consumers share pro rata for the first two years      Non Core pay    after two years  SB  XX amended  No Provisions  Transmission System Purchase SB  XX and SB  XX No purchase of transmission assets  Conservation Easements SB  XX No conservation easements  SB  XX amended  Specific conservation easements and other land arrangements described in bill for about     acres per the Governor s MOU  Direct Access SB  XX Removes regulatory constraints on a Direct Access program effective January      and permits customers to buy power if there is a net short after SoCal native generation  bilateral contracts  and DWR contracts  Residential and small commercial customers may use direct access from renewable energy sources  SB  XX amended  No provisions for Direct Access  Ratepayer Benefit Account SB  XX Deposits in the account any refunds or net cash resulting from  a  any refunds ordered by FERC or from litigation  and  b  any positive DWR Power Fund revenues  all to be refunded to ratepayers through either bill credits or rate reductions in proportion to the March    PUC rate increase  SB  XX amended  Does not create a Ratepayer Benefit Account  Electric Supplier Claims Settlement Trust SB  XX and SB  XX Does not create a Trust or trustee to negotiate reductions  Renewable Energy SB  XX Creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard  RPS  to achieve a target of    of all new generating capacity additions through   and overall    of statewide total generating capacity by    Munis have been exempted from the RPS  SB  XX amended  No provisions for renewable energy   \n",

Setting Authority In Question Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call MOU As reported earlier  SB  XX  the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA Senate  has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly  Three important revisions on the bill are  In regard to commercial rates  the assembly has now left open the definition of large or  industrial users  by eliminating the previous   kWh  usage requirement  This change could enable the Assembly to categorize either smaller or larger consumers into the industrial commercial user status The bill would not become effective unless SB  XX is signed into law  SB  XX  authored by Sen  Speier  is regarding the CPUC s authority over utilities and generators in California  it places certain generation that was purchased by Reliant  Dynegy  etc  from the utilities after deregulation under PUC authority  The State s purchase of the SoCal Ed  transmission lines has been removed  AB  XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provisions duplicate in SB  XX  such as the conservation lands and the option to buy the transmission lines  Additionally  AB  XX can not be enacted unless SB  XX  the windfall profits bill  is signed  The joining of  XX to SB  XX and of  XX to  XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is pressuring the governor to sign these other bills  which otherwise might not have been enrolled  However  the joining of these bills makes their passage more difficult  The remaining provisions of AB  XX are as follows  Renewables Portfolio Direct Access Ratepayer Refund Account  changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account  Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power DRC replaced with non bypassable charge option for MOU  This includes reference to balancing account  recovery of reasonable procurement costs  and the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC  Putting the MOU to a Vote The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already  so nothing is really new  Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night      pm  to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday  It probably has a lot to do with the ability to get enough members  support of these measures and willingness to go back to Sacramento  Many are vacationing  some in other countries  If there is an Assembly session on Friday  he plans to have an informational hearing on the measure today  If the Assembly s session fails to convene Friday  it is unclear what he intends to do  On the other side of the equation  it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back into session to approve this bill  The Senate won t even consider it until it comes back from recess  but the Assembly feels it is their responsibility  thereby putting the onus back on the Senate  Apparently there is really no coordination between the leadership of the different houses  While SB  XX and AB  XX are the most publicized bills  neither bill will be the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions  The proposed content of these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the process  thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold numerous hearings  This will speed up the process  Apparently the Speaker s office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used  But they hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the Senate  It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through as two separate bills  though  with the SB  XX provisions in one bill and the AB  XX provisions in another  CPUC  Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority Recently  the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUC s rate setting authority and hand over that power to the California legislature  Politically  this gives the Governor the ability to say  if rates increase automatically  that he did not approve of the rate increase  and there is nothing he can do about it  But it also gives Wall Street buyers of California s revenue bonds assurances that no matter what the need  there will always be enough revenue to back revenue bonds payments  thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for bondholders  Were this provision to pass  the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates for the investor owned utilities  As for DWR  under the draft rate agreement proposed by the CPUC  it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in setting electricity rates that satisfy DWR s  revenue requirement   DWR s revenue requirements include bond related costs  operating costs  such as power purchase costs   and administrative costs  AB X provided for energy related bonds to be sold by the state to support DWR s power purchases  Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it makes bond payments  and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues  the rate setting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWR s power purchases not just its bond payments  Note that if the Commission adopts a rate agreement  it becomes irrevocable   The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements  The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWR s requirements in either   or   days  The   day mechanism applies whenever DWR submits a revenue requirement  The   day mechanism applies when DWR anticipates or actually draws on its reserves  The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifying how the Commission will set rates to meet DWR s revenue requirements  which includes both bond costs and operating costs   If the CPUC s draft rate agreement is approved  there will be no legislative or PUC oversight of any of those costs  and no opportunity for public comment for as long as bonds are outstanding  If a rate agreement can be avoided  there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreement s demand management and administrative costs  Either way  power contract costs remain an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR and the contractor  SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders of defaulted debt    July        PDT  In order for California to sell their revenue bonds with an investment grade rating  two criterion must be met     there must be a rate supported  dedicated revenue stream in place and    the legislature must have the power to override of the CPUC s rate setting authority and raise rates if necessary  The second criterion  however  faces significant opposition from the California State Constitution  Regarding the DWR rate requirement  Craver  the spokesperson for SoCal  stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers  particularly on the DWR side  He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers  it appears this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure  However   we need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be wrong   Therefore  this is  risky  in that SoCal is faced with  fixed revenues and floating costs   Unlike DWR  SoCal has no ability to adjust rates based on costs  making floating natural gas prices a risk  Prudential asked  if based on the Hertzberg legislation  the sale of the transmission assets is now off the table  SoCal responded that this is correct  Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more securitization  i e   be securitized for all but    million with an option to buy the transmission assets at book for   years  SoCal responded that it was  unclear what the pricing  of the transmission assets  would be  but there would be an option  for the state to purchase the transmission assets  Prudential asked about the status of the remaining  non legislative  implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation   XX and  XX  contains them  SoCal responded that there are   outstanding issues remaining for implementing the MOU     Ratemaking for the utilities  retained generation  The PUC is holding hearings on this issue this week  These hearings have slowed the process  A decision is expected by the end of August     A procurement plan for the utility  This plan is before the PUC  SoCal suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before acting on this point  Regardless  the company needs an  adequate balancing account with an automatic rate trigger      Clarification on the utility holding company s position regarding  st priority  On this front  the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three utilities and their holding companies  The three holding companies have challenged this decision  Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision in favor of the challenge  a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday  This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from the holding companies  but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay the debts of the utilities  Deutsche Bank asked if  in SoCal s numbers reported to date  it was assuming the charges for ancillary services  SoCal responded that DWR had confirmed as of   January that it would pick up these charges  These charges would otherwise amount to    million      billion in additional revenue requirement for the utility  Based on FERC rulings  SoCal had not been counting on paying these charges  so they are not reflected in the company s numbers  However  SoCal will be paying grid management and uplift charges  They anticipate paying  some portion  of these charges  This could potentially require an amended URG filing  Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues  Edison responded that they are  working on new facilities on the bank side   The current facilities expire on October  th or  th  Edison indicated it is in the process of finalizing sales of approximately    MW of non strategic assets  They are in negotiations with the final bidders except for Hopewell  which is done  There is no specific timeline on when the deals will be announced  but it is a matter of days to a week  Appalucia Management asked if  on SoCal s generation  DWR is assuming a cost plus or retail rate  SoCal responded that it uses cost of service based rates  The return on the       rate basis is approximately       cents  The      stipulated covers SoCal s generation  its contracted generation  QF costs  which were quoted as the most significant portion  and uncollectables  This is driven by gas costs for the QFs  Revenue is fixed at        \n",

                                   Just got a call from Hertzberg  He pulled the plug last night on trying to get an Edison MOU finished by this weekend  Too complicated  too rushed  he couldn t pull it off  but intends to continue working with folks  He said that likelihood now is that the Assembly will recess  come back on the  th  and try again  Since the Legislature has adjourned without resolving the Edison energy issue  the focus will now be at the CPUC  which is scheduled to rule on a rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC  Direct Access suspension  etc  at its August  rd meeting

                                         Summary of the activities since Friday  Overall  it s     or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget and recess until August  th  without having passed some form of an  Edison MOU   Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and passed through both houses by COB Monday  In the Senate  The  Edison MOU   As previously reported  on Friday  SB     the Senate s version of the Edison MOU  passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate  The bill sticks    of suppliers  debts with Edison s shareholders but pays QFs and other creditors  The authors believe that suppliers can t force Edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the PX  not Edison  which in their view means that the suppliers can t reach Edison  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective  The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system  but rejects the Goernor s MOU  which buys it outright  Though there s some uncertainty  the bill appears to end Direct Access  Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB   in its current form  Enron  and the marjority of market participants  opposes    The  Dunn Investigation   Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday  The report recommends that the Senate fine us  beginning with      the first day  and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron  complies   Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday  In response  our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate  Ross Johnson   and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn  She was successful   Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August  th  If the Senate returns early  it could vote prior to the  th  but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time  The budget  The Senate passed the budget at about   AM Sunday morning  The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August  th  That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU  The Assembly In short  leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party  the Democrats  The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue  Unable to do a deal  the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened  It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget  The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU  which it says it intends to do  Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning  Late Saturday night  the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU  AB  XX   but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it  Enron  together with business customers  opposes the version of  XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access  Best  Jeff  \n",

Jennifer Coleman Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO  AP     The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by Gov  Gray Davis to help the struggling utility Southern California Edison  The bill approved Friday  authored by Democratic Sens  Richard Polanco and Byron Sher  lets Edison issue      billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record high levels in the last year   I believe it s a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity     and to bring this entity to creditworthiness   said Polanco  D Los Angeles  Approved      the bill now goes to the Assembly  The Assembly adjourned Friday night without voting on a similar measure  The Polanco Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by Edison  which says it won t help the company escape bankruptcy  Davis  plan  announced in April  offers Edison      billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated      billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices  Under the plan by Polanco  and Sher  of Stanford  the state has a five year option to buy Edison s grid  That  said Republican Sen  Ross Johnson of Irvine  gives Edison a bailout it  neither needs nor deserves   I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim  They have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn t support deregulation   Johnson said during floor debate   The idea of Edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers  Edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation   During the     deliberations that led to deregulation  Edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then Gov  Pete Wilson  a Republican  Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug     a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding between Davis and Edison  That says the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug      It s a firm deadline  which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess   Davis said Friday  For that to happen  either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg  D Van Nuys  and Assemblyman Fred Keeley  D Boulder Creek  has to reach Davis   I have problems with both bills   Davis said   I am heartened by the fact that there s a bill moving in each house   The Keeley Hertzberg plan trims at least    million from the governor s offer  It also allows Edison to issue the bonds  which would be repaid by Edison ratepayers over   years  The plan also attempts to increase the state s use of  green  energy resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct access energy service  The Assembly didn t vote on the Keeley bill Friday  because Hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to  iron out the bills  differences   said Hertzberg s spokesman Paul Hefner  Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the Aug    deadline   I don t want people to go out fishing for   days and come back and worry about it on Aug    because I know we re going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month   the governor said  On the Net  Read the bills  AB

                                         FYI  Fairly accurate account of the activities in California  Assembly released new version of Hertzberg s bill late last night  Another update to follow shortly  Best  Jeff State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy Assembly plans own version for utility Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay  Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday  July         San Francisco Chronicle URL  Sacramento    The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern California Edison from falling into bankruptcy  but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov  Gray Davis faces an uncertain future  The bill by Democratic Sens  Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of Palo Alto would give the state a five year option to buy the utility s transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than      billion of the utility s debt  Edison amassed an estimated      billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen  The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night  but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to California s botched   deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers  Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before Aug     a date set in the original agreement between Davis and Edison  Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night  but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town   It s a firm deadline  which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess   Davis said of the Aug    date  Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills  but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days   I have problems with both bills   Davis said   I am heartened by the fact that there s a bill moving in each house   Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote  and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process  In the Senate    Democrats voted for the Edison plan  while four Democrats and all   Republicans voted no  Sen  Jackie Speier  D Hillsborough  said she would vote for the bill in its current form  but not if any substantial changes are made   The Legislature is ill equipped to try to craft a deal   she said   This particular measure    and only this one    has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers  I m leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being cannibalized   The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue      billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks  The bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged Edison s largest customers and would not cover the    billion Edison owes out of state generators  Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy  which would put it back in the position of buying power  The state has been spending upward of    million a day on power since January  and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power  There is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas   Electric Co  out of bankruptcy  In the Assembly  two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill  The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley  D Boulder Creek  was undergoing changes to garner more support  Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal  Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist  D San Jose  one of the undecided members on the Edison agreement  said the original bill was too complex   It s a cleaner bill   Alquist said   I think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG E  I would say I m tentatively satisfied   Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the Edison negotiations  Only a few members of the Assembly    all former state senators now in the lower house    voted to approve the   legislation  AB   that brought deregulation to California  Assemblyman Joseph Simitian  D Palo Alto  said he gave a courtesy vote to the Hertzberg Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee  in order to get the measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate   As we ve learned from the experience of AB   the devil is in the details  I have a lot of questions   Simitian said   The difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline  and then once there is a deadline  too much gets done   Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed  but he said lawmakers are well informed about the energy crisis and its details  He said they have had   hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis  A wild card in the Assembly s plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright  D  Los Angeles  that garnered Republican support  The so called  straight bailout  would give Edison its      billion through a    a month fee levied on utility ratepayers  It was stuck in

acquired by Hewlett Packard for    million  and Amber Networks is being acquired by Nokia for    million  If I am not mistaken  these are the   largest technology acquisitions of    where only a handful of acquisitions have been made in total all year   Net gains to Enron on both of these investments  which were both made in    will be small  but the acquisitions are a verification of EBS Ventures ability to pick the best telecom investments in the market  no other single investor is in both of these deals   Steven Sheldon and Patrick Hickey deserve tremendous credit for originating and managing these investments  Thanks  Kevin Garland Enron Principal Investments  \n",

                                               Here is an update of our activities  All of my standard reports should be completed by the end of next week  which will allow me to provide thorough and concise report of all positions and values  Portfolio Management Completed assignment of all portfolio companies to senior team members Sold    stake in Paladin Resources  a UK public E P company  for  p totaling    million  This was a good price  average price LTM of  p   but was below the quarter end price  Therefore  there is a Q  loss of      million  Andrew Marsden is managing this in London  Completed all requirements to sell COPEL shares  a     million investment in the Brazilian utility   Began selling shares on      Current price is approximately    million below carrying value of approximately    million  Likely to take a couple of months to exit entire position  Investment is carried as  Strategic   and any losses upon the sale will fall  below the line  in the sale of non merchant asset line  Steven Sheldon is managing this  Completed negotiations on the sale of Utiliquest for      million  Should sign on Thursday  Enron had invested      million in cash  net of JEDI II  and will receive      million  The sale will net a cash gain to Enron  but below our carrying value of      million  yielding a    million accounting loss  Kevin Kuykendall is managing this  Finalized processes to begin selling Hanover Compressor shares  We own     million shares  which are trading at      share for a total value of    million  Hanover has been hedged through Raptor  However  the structure that was used to hedge is a costless collar that leaves Enron exposed below      share  Therefore  at current trading levels we are facing a    million loss  We are working with CSFB  which has proposed to execute a block trade sale  However  the stock continues to decline each day  and CSFB will not make an offer until the price stabilizes  If we have to sell at a block discount  or if the price continues to fall we could be facing a    million to    million loss  Needless to say  we are very focused on this investment  Losses from Venture Capital positions appear to be approximately    million for Q   which is primarily the result of write offs in the HEOF portfolio  Net quarterly expectations  Cash proceeds received from sales       million  losses from sales below carrying value     million     million  above the line  and    million  below the line    Integration All personnel decisions made  Legal  Gil Melman   RAC  Randy Petersen   accounting  Hope

readers got this story today    Retail market can be opened nationally      Joe Barton thinks it can and is about to try     Once in   years opportunity seen How can the retail power market be opened in today s atmosphere  Joe Barton has a way and it sounds like it just might work  He briefed APPA members winding up the last day of the annual meeting in Washington  Barton implored the membership that if they have any ideas on how to improve energy policy  this is the time to tell policy makers or him  Barton sees a narrow  six week opportunity as America is about to revise its energy policy  We walked with him to his car after the speech and asked what he means by a major energy restructuring bill  He referred vaguely to legislation that would improve the grid and foster the functioning of a robust market providing for movement of power from one place to another  He wants a national market with a grid that can handle it  in an open access way    creating all these trading markets where you have long term and short term markets where you balance supply and demand around the country   States that have surplus power  through the RTO system can wheel that power to states that need it   That s the wholesale market  we asked  Yes  But what about retail  He hopes to get into the law a provision to foster aggregation of buyers  How would that work   AARP   Barton said noticing our age   could sell you power or Wal  Mart or McDonalds or the co ops  You could buy your power through them   How would a law provide for aggregation   It would be in the federal legislation that it would be permitted   he replied  But what about Nebraska where there are only munis   You ve got to work through that and see if you get some kind of grandfather or state opt out provision  It s possible that you give states the right to opt out  But over time those states will want to opt in   he added   That ll be a debate we ll have when we get into the bill  You re not supposed to ask that tough a question this early in the process   he reminded with a smile  Barton is really impressed with the magnitude of the legislation gestating in the nation s capital   Everything  is up for discussion  he said   everything   There is nothing    nothing    that s been debated or talked about in terms of electricity that is not on the table   Barton assured   I m not saying we re going to do it all but you have a window like this once every   to   years  I m going to be damned if I m going to stand around and on my on volition take things off the table   Now the process will automatically take a lot more controversial items out of play  There ll be a region or a political block    who knows the president might not like something  John Dingell might not like something  Who knows  But I m not    even before we put pen to paper to start drafting the bill    say  we re not going to consider this    Barton added  Is he getting signals from Dingell that he might be cooperative   Yeah  Very cooperative  Of course  again  the proof is in the pudding and in the details   Barton s in the leadership role in fostering a national energy policy  taking the package from the vice president and guiding it through the House  He s the president s energy guy from an energy state and Bush has shown    with the tax bill    that he can get a program enacted  Barton wants something he can look back at in five    and   years and say  that s a good bill  It works   Barton wants to make history with the Energy Policy Act of    Barton told APPA he wants this big bill to be  national  long term in its impact and balanced   Balanced means looking at the generation component  transmission and distribution  and in each of those areas    this is just me  I m not speaking for anyone but myself     he wants  to create an environment so we have a maximum  competitive situation that s open and fair to everybody   And we re going to do that and you re going to have a lot of competition  a lot of flexibility with a lot of choice for consumers and a lot of choice for yourself   Barton added  Wait a minute  He s saying competition in transmission and distribution  We really do need to ask him what he has in mind there when the time is right  We can t help but think of competition in selling pipeline capacity in a secondary market  You can do that with electricity capacity to or on a local distribution system in gas  We re thinking aloud here  That s not what Barton said  He wants to minimize the federal role except where you actually have to  That puts Barton  a little at variance with some in the Bush Administration and some in the Congress because in the modern age there s a natural proclivity to centralize and consolidate which in the political arena means let Washington do it   Barton wants to maximize the technology component and will put into the bill a distributed generation component  He s interested in negawatts  fostering cut backs in demand on a national scale   Looking out for your own interest   Barton considers to be  democracy   But from time to time you have to step back and look at the national interest  he advocated   That s my job   Today s crisis mentality helps Congress act boldly  The friendliness to competitive markets in the White House encouraged by the president s pride about the retail bill he got through the Texas Legislature plus today s environment may be ideal for market  minded leaders  You can benefit from Restructuring Today s special  unique focus on the converging energy and communications
